Before we get into the nuts and bolts of the job, how about some reasons you might want to come onboard?

Yes, we’re small(35 consultants), but the foundations are laid, and properly too. What that means to you is an unrivaled opportunity to thrive at what you do best. This is your opportunity to be in on the ground floor of something really special. We won't be small for long. We already have 35 consultants across Canada and are looking to aggressively grow the team.

Created in Canada in 2013, we created a platform that is completely remote; allowing employees to work from wherever in Canada they choose. We have focused on creating a platform and environment that allows consultants tools to be able to focus on the markets they know best and help them make money. Remote is not a Covid experiment for us, it is how we were built!


Knowing the job is the key to success, quickly followed by attitude. Below is a wish list, but if you think you’d be interesting to us, please let us know.

There really is a very different, but very cool opportunity on offer here, we love what we do, and we’d love you to join us.
