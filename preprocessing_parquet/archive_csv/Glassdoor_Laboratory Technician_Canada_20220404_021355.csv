Description:
About us:

The Faculty of Arts & Science is the heart of Canada’s leading university and one of the most comprehensive and diverse academic divisions in the world. The strength of Arts & Science derives from our combined teaching and research excellence in the humanities, sciences and social sciences across 29 departments, seven colleges and 46 interdisciplinary centres, institutes and programs.

We can only realize our mission with the dedication and excellence of engaged staff and faculty. The diversity of opportunities and perspectives within the Faculty reflect the local and global landscape and the need for curiosity, innovative thinking and collaboration. At Arts & Science, we take pride in our legacy of innovation and discovery that has changed the way we think about the world.



The Department of Cell & Systems Biology promotes research and teaching in some of the most dynamic and vital areas of biological research. We facilitate the pursuit of cutting-edge research in the molecular life sciences and systems biology and embrace new methodologies and state-of-the-art technologies. Located in downtown Toronto and part of the University of Toronto, one of the world’s top research universities, our department is an ideal place to work, research and make a lasting impression in the field.

Under direction of the Principal Investigator, Professor Tony Harris, this positionwill. be central to a research program pursuing the molecular and cellular mechanisms of early animal development. Specifically, the Harris lab pursues how cells and tissues are built. Using the Drosophila embryo as a model system, their core approach isto manipulate molecules with genetics and to visualize effects on molecular complexes, cells and tissues using spinning disk confocal microscopy. The group investigates how cytoskeletal networks form and function to shape cells and tissues, studying specific molecular regulators of these networks as well as how distinct networks impact each other, the cell cortex, and cell-cell adhesion complexes for multicellular development. They study cell polarity (how pathways direct assembly of molecular materials to particular locations of the cell), self-organization (how molecular control circuits amplify or downregulate complex formation), and emergent, multi-scale effects (how the positioning and activities of molecular materials induce physical changes to whole cells or tissues). Generating molecular tools for these studies is critical. For more details, see https://csb.utoronto.ca/faculty/tony-j-c-harris/"

Description:
About us:

The Faculty of Arts & Science is the heart of Canada’s leading university and one of the most comprehensive and diverse academic divisions in the world. The strength of Arts & Science derives from our combined teaching and research excellence in the humanities, sciences and social sciences across 29 departments, seven colleges and 46 interdisciplinary centres, institutes and programs.

We can only realize our mission with the dedication and excellence of engaged staff and faculty. The diversity of opportunities and perspectives within the Faculty reflect the local and global landscape and the need for curiosity, innovative thinking and collaboration. At Arts & Science, we take pride in our legacy of innovation and discovery that has changed the way we think about the world.



The Department of Cell & Systems Biology promotes research and teaching in some of the most dynamic and vital areas of biological research. We facilitate the pursuit of cutting-edge research in the molecular life sciences and systems biology and embrace new methodologies and state-of-the-art technologies. Located in downtown Toronto and part of the University of Toronto, one of the world’s top research universities, our department is an ideal place to work, research and make a lasting impression in the field.

Under direction of the Principal Investigator, Professor Tony Harris, this positionwill. be central to a research program pursuing the molecular and cellular mechanisms of early animal development. Specifically, the Harris lab pursues how cells and tissues are built. Using the Drosophila embryo as a model system, their core approach isto manipulate molecules with genetics and to visualize effects on molecular complexes, cells and tissues using spinning disk confocal microscopy. The group investigates how cytoskeletal networks form and function to shape cells and tissues, studying specific molecular regulators of these networks as well as how distinct networks impact each other, the cell cortex, and cell-cell adhesion complexes for multicellular development. They study cell polarity (how pathways direct assembly of molecular materials to particular locations of the cell), self-organization (how molecular control circuits amplify or downregulate complex formation), and emergent, multi-scale effects (how the positioning and activities of molecular materials induce physical changes to whole cells or tissues). Generating molecular tools for these studies is critical. For more details, see https://csb.utoronto.ca/faculty/tony-j-c-harris/"

Description:
About us:

The Faculty of Arts & Science is the heart of Canada’s leading university and one of the most comprehensive and diverse academic divisions in the world. The strength of Arts & Science derives from our combined teaching and research excellence in the humanities, sciences and social sciences across 29 departments, seven colleges and 46 interdisciplinary centres, institutes and programs.

We can only realize our mission with the dedication and excellence of engaged staff and faculty. The diversity of opportunities and perspectives within the Faculty reflect the local and global landscape and the need for curiosity, innovative thinking and collaboration. At Arts & Science, we take pride in our legacy of innovation and discovery that has changed the way we think about the world.



The Department of Cell & Systems Biology promotes research and teaching in some of the most dynamic and vital areas of biological research. We facilitate the pursuit of cutting-edge research in the molecular life sciences and systems biology and embrace new methodologies and state-of-the-art technologies. Located in downtown Toronto and part of the University of Toronto, one of the world’s top research universities, our department is an ideal place to work, research and make a lasting impression in the field.

Under direction of the Principal Investigator, Professor Tony Harris, this positionwill. be central to a research program pursuing the molecular and cellular mechanisms of early animal development. Specifically, the Harris lab pursues how cells and tissues are built. Using the Drosophila embryo as a model system, their core approach isto manipulate molecules with genetics and to visualize effects on molecular complexes, cells and tissues using spinning disk confocal microscopy. The group investigates how cytoskeletal networks form and function to shape cells and tissues, studying specific molecular regulators of these networks as well as how distinct networks impact each other, the cell cortex, and cell-cell adhesion complexes for multicellular development. They study cell polarity (how pathways direct assembly of molecular materials to particular locations of the cell), self-organization (how molecular control circuits amplify or downregulate complex formation), and emergent, multi-scale effects (how the positioning and activities of molecular materials induce physical changes to whole cells or tissues). Generating molecular tools for these studies is critical. For more details, see https://csb.utoronto.ca/faculty/tony-j-c-harris/"
