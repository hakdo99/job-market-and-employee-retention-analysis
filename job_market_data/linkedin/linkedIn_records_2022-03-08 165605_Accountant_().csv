With the support to do things differently, grow personally and professionally and bring your whole self to work, there’s no limit to the impact you can make. Let’s do this.


The Opportunity 


KPMG’s Accounting Advisory Services in Toronto is looking for Senior Managers to join our dynamic team. The Accounting Advisory Services team is a group of dedicated professionals, with a collaborative working environment that leverages the strengths of the team members, who are committed to providing the best possible service to our clients.

We are currently looking for a Senior Manager that is passionate about technical accounting, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy and reporting, and delivering exceptional client service. The ideal candidate has a track record of growth and enjoys helping clients and engagement teams resolve complex accounting issues by providing technical accounting advice. This is an excellent opportunity to grow your career servicing some of the largest and most exciting clients in the market. At KPMG, we’ll provide you with the support to drive your own career and discover the countless opportunities available.

The Senior Manager position will involve applying technical knowledge of accounting policies and standards under IFRS, US GAAP and ASPE.

At Bench, we really believe that people are everything, and our Accounting Associates play one of the most pivotal roles; providing the right mix of elegant and intelligent client assistance, and delivering bookkeeping for small businesses using our revolutionary software and app. Our Associates are directly responsible for helping our clients survive and thrive through monthly and historical bookkeeping. This is important now, more than ever.

You'll maintain relationships with small business owners from various industries, both on the phone and through our proprietary bookkeeping platform. With or without an accounting background, we'll provide you with all the tools and training you'll need to be a highly successful Associate.

In a typical week, Associates will spend roughly 60% of their time completing bookkeeping tasks, 30% of their time communicating with clients, and 10% of their time in meetings or trainings.


A highly successful Associate looks something like this:



Excited by numbers, simple math, or problem-solving, and are content with repeat, detailed work

Be able to communicate clearly and articulately on the phone and in messaging. (Note: We do not believe in the idea of ""standard"" accents for the English language.)

Motivated to build a global success story with us. Working for a start-up requires flexibility and resilience

Data driven: if you're someone that thrives off of metrics, statistics, and quarterly targets then you'll fit right in. 

A people-centered approach: you understand that people are everything. You're collaborative, optimistic and you listen to understand, demonstrating kindness and empathy in all interactions.

A drive to make things better: You're not satisfied with ""good enough"", and nothing that needs fixing is just someone else's job. You love to experiment, try new things, and drive improvement; within your own team, and across the organization.

Startup hustle: You are highly motivated, proactive, comfortable with change and ambiguity. You have a humble, team-player attitude and are ready to pitch in wherever you are needed most

Constant learning: This role is as challenging as it is rewarding. As long as you're someone who's eager to tackle new challenges and quick to learn new concepts, we'll get you up to speed in no time.

Proficient computer user: You're very comfortable using computers. Working in Microsoft Office Suite is a breeze for you and learning new software is something you enjoy. 




What's next: 



We will review your application, and if you are successful, a Recruiter will be in touch to schedule a first-round Zoom interview with our recruiter. 

Following a successful first interview, there will be a second Zoom interview with two of our hiring managers. You can expect an interactive activity as part of the interview at this stage. 




The extra details:



This is a full-time permanent position because we want to spend lots of time with your wonderful self!

This position offers an annual salary, and an extended benefits package that includes health, dental, and vision.

All Benchmates have access to Inkblot Therapy, our virtual counselling service to support mental wellbeing, and Bravely, our confidential, on-demand, 1:1 professional coaching service.

At Bench we share information freely and openly whenever possible. All Associates joining the team will start at a base salary of $42,300. From there, with the Tax Season Bonus and Variable Pay, the On Target Earnings (OTE) for the role is $48,300.

Our HQ is in Vancouver BC, where we offer hybrid and remote working opportunities. This full-time position also has the flexibility to work remotely from anywhere else in BC, as well as Alberta, Ontario, and New Brunswick. Whether working remote or hybrid, we'll set you up with everything you need to work from home, from day one.




Everyone has their own unique talents. Even if you don't meet 100% of the qualifications outlined above, tell us why you'd be a great fit for this role in your application.



We believe that unchecked biases disproportionately impact the most marginalized people in society—including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQ2S+ people, immigrants, and people with disabilities. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities because we believe that without you, we are all less. At Bench, we don't stand for tokenism. We stand for representation.

About The Company


FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.


 $2.4B Annual Revenue 

 600,000 Directly Served Business Clients 

 2.6B+ Transactions per Year 

 8,400+ Employees 



 (as of December 31, 2020)


Our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.


FLEETCOR Enjoys Global Recognition Including



 Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista 

 Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row! 

 Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking#872 

 S&amp;P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&amp;P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value) 



 Our Vision


Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.


 Our Mission


FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.


Our Strategy


FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:


 More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions. 

 More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example: 

 Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job. 

 Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food. 

 For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.


 More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships. 



 Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging 



We Are Therefore Committed To Building And Nurturing a Culture Of Diversity, Inclusion, And Belonging By
