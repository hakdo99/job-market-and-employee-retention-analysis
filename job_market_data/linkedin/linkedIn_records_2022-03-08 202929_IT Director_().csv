Job Title


Director, Software Development Engineering

The Software Engineering Director is responsible for leading the technical team/s of engineers and overseeing architecture direction and development for new and existing systems. In this role you will work together with project management and product owners to meet time/cost objectives, counsel and mentor team members, and conduct performance evaluations and career planning. A successful Engineering Director will help refine best practices and processes to ensure the team produces documented, high-quality, stable and high-performance applications for Ekata.

Another important responsibility would be the technology champion for various other Mastercard teams and groups who want to integrate with IDV Hub. The role would involve high involvement with Mastercard’s data and platform strategy and continue to evolve it.

Your ideal job should be to create highly efficient self-managed teams and be empowered to make yourself and your team more productive on a daily basis. You should want to be part of a team where your desire to grow and learn is valued and aptly rewarded; where innovating and executing are core to your teams' beliefs.


In The Software Engineering Director Role You Will


Lead, coach and further develop team/s of engineers and managers through regular 1:1s, feedback sessions, and performance reviews

Partner with Product to establish project objectives, estimates, and schedules

Interface with other teams for their IDV needs

Ensure team/s understands and meets business project objectives and requirements

Ensure the development and maintenance of team’s standards and procedures that result in an environment compliant with company policies

Drive recruiting and interviewing candidates to make successful hires

Support the growth and learning of team members, through mentorship and supporting professional learning opportunities

Grow as a leader via mentoring and training, and give and receive quarterly evaluations

Excellent spoken and written English skills. Good interpersonal skills, open and honest communication

Good experience in more areas of relevant expertise: SaaS, AWS, distributed computing, big data or machine learning projects and solutions


COVID-19 Considerations 


We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.


Corporate Security Responsibility



Responsibilities


All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must


Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;

Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;

Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and

Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines.

        Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

Moving software to the cloud has been revolutionary for businesses, especially around costs. But if you're a software architect with a strategic or financial bent, you know so many companies are merely scratching the surface. If that's you - we want to hear from you!

Trilogy seeks system-level thinkers to dive deep into software architecture and identify repeatable cost-saving opportunities with material business impact. You will be designing solutions that systematically cut millions of dollars of cloud costs for Fortune 500 companies.

Anybody can stuff their on-premises setup in some containers, push it to the cloud, and save money. And there are plenty of teams who can do some bill hacking, focusing solely on the billing and cloud watch metrics. But we want someone truly technical to go deeper and look for fundamental ways to re-architect software to use AWS in a meaningful way. Cost matters, but the quality of our products comes first. And as AWS rolls out new products, we want someone excited to learn these new products and put them to use to cut costs further.

This role will provide daily learning opportunities because of the footprint and scope of our cloud implementations. You will have a laboratory to experiment with your ideas. You will find opportunities to test and validate them within our vast portfolio. And you get to stay on the cutting edge, assessing, experimenting with, and deploying the latest and greatest AWS offerings.

If you want to impact our cloud economics and are ready to expand your professional development beyond code into strategic and financial decision-making, this is the role for you!



What You Will Be Doing



Each week you will have a different cost optimization problem to work on and technical specs to create. You will be:


Identifying patterns in complex systems and finding ways to make them 10x simpler

Making important decisions that specify how to systematically optimize cloud resource consumption, simplify architecture, and improve the quality of the product simultaneously

Distilling those decisions into precise and well-documented written technical specifications that a team of engineers can implement

Learning and working on a wide variety of products with distinct tech stacks and business domains




What You Won’t Be Doing




Ignoring technical implementation and focusing solely on financial metrics

Managing vendors or negotiating contracts

Providing day-to-day direction to an engineering team




Director Of Information Technology Key Responsibilities




Make clear, simple, technically superior design decisions that optimize cost

Deliver data-driven decisions that are rooted in technical depth

Produce detailed written specifications that put your insights into action




Basic Requirements




4+ years of experience making important architecture and design decisions on software projects, such as the application of architecture design patterns or significant open source technologies

Experience making important cloud cost decisions at a company with an annual cloud spend of at least USD 100,000

2+ years of experience shipping production-quality code

2+ years of experience as the decision-maker for the use of cloud-based services such as Amazon Web Services, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform

Great analytical skills and sound financial acumen




About Trilogy



Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack. Trilogy is a place where you can be surrounded with great people, be proud of doing great work, and grow your career by leaps and bounds.

There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!

Account manager




About the job.


 We’re looking for the type of person that thrives on saving the day. You know the one. The superhero type. The one that runs towards danger while others are running away.







Oh, hey.


 Does the idea of trying to control the unique chaos of an agency filled with smart, passionate and admittedly strange people get you a bit excited? If you answered yes and are a proud to be a control freak, we should talk. 







The gig.


 Account manager. We’re looking for a Account manager to join our team but not just any Account manager. We need the really special kind.






You’re going to spend part of your day working directly with 3-5 of our clients and part of your day leading a team of coordinators and creatives – creative coordinators and uncoordinated creatives (we’re really hoping our creatives don’t read this).






The deets. Do the kids still say “deets?” Honestly, we’re not sure. We got lost at “on fleek.” Anyways, let’s get serious with a serious-looking list of what we’re hoping you have:







Laugh (or cry and laugh) at chaos:
 A lot happens in a typical agency day and it all seemingly happens at once. Whatever you thought busy and hectic was….double it. You need to be someone who thrives in chaos and can clearly see the path out.







We may be looking for (another) unicorn: 
In another life, you were probably a creative director. You can pitch and have a strong creative eye. You feel comfortable in client meetings on your own and can see the big picture. You can guide clients through initial strategic thinking, talk social and get pretty pumped about kerning. You're probably a bit of a generalist.







Experience. You've got some: 
You're going to be working directly with some pretty big, global brands. It's important for you you to understand how these organizations work and be able to navigate your way through. You're probably hanging out at another agency, looking for a new challenge or client-side yearning for some chaos. You most likely have somewhere in the 5-8 year range of experience.







Your average day: 
You'll get an email from a client with a new project. You'll whip up a brief and book an initial discovery meeting right before you jump into into an already booked discovery meeting with another client. In that meeting, you will take the lead, asking questions to better understand the need while providing some initial strategic direction.






You'll check in with your team on some outstanding items, review design before packaging it up and sending it off to a client. You then find yourself in a meeting where you'll be leading a pitch on a new campaign and then off to pull together a budget for a video. You'll wrap the day with a team meeting before grabbing a bite with a client.






Rinse and repeat but different, every day.







Customer focused: 
Human-centered design thinking is at the base of everything we do and you’re able to understand our customer’s perspective. Their happiness is paramount in everything you do and you get that. You're driven by making people happy - you may even be a little driven by making sure you never let people down.







Team leader:
 You were unanimously voted project lead in every elementary, junior high, high school and university project. You have the ability to rally the team and speak multiple languages: client, project team, creative. 







Attention to details:
 You love the details. You sweat the details and you pick up on everything that everyone else missed. Your friends and family are probably annoyed by it (but we’ll love it).







Problem solver:
 “I don’t know” is not in your vocabulary… but “I can figure it out” definitely is! Problem solving and a willingness to figure things out with minimal direction is essential. You’re autonomous, yet highly communicative. You get it done and keep everyone in the loop while you do.







One more time:
 The one above this is pretty important, so we wanted to say it again. We need the kind of person who can take something and own it; someone who wants to be involved in everything and has the dedication to follow through.







Agile:
 We’re a growing company and we’ll be honest…we don’t always have our stuff together. We’re “building the plane while we fly”, so to speak. You’ll need to be someone that can embrace this chaos on top of the typical agency chaos.







Organized: 
You love Gantt charts, scheduling and probably have a case just for your highlighters (iykyk). You've got to love autonomy and have the ability to keep yourself organized. 







Tech geek(ish):
 You get technology and are comfortable is using because, well, we use it all the time.

Position Overview



The 
Department of Stewardship 
in the 
Office of Advancement Services
 is currently seeking a Full-time Regular 
Recognition &amp; Engagement Specialist
.

The University of Calgary is Canada's leading next-generation university: a living, growing and youthful institution that embraces change and opportunity with a can-do attitude. Located in the nation's most enterprising city, the University is making tremendous progress on its Eyes High journey to be recognized as one of Canada's top five research universities, grounded in innovative learning and teaching and fully integrated with the community it both serves and leads. The University of Calgary inspires and supports discovery, creativity and innovation across all disciplines.

The Recognition Specialist will embrace achievement of these goals as they apply to celebrating our donors through excellent stewardship and recognition. Reporting to the Director, Stewardship, the successful candidate will contribute to meaningful communications, stewardship and recognition that celebrates new and existing donors; informs and educates future donors; and creates consistency with how we engage UCalgary stakeholders as it relates to philanthropy.

The goal of the Recognition Specialist is to ensure that UCalgary remains relevant and competitive in all aspects of donor recognition and mitigates reputational risk to the institution through rigorous counsel and governance regarding policy and process adherence. This will be achieved through benchmarking, specialized industry awareness, networking with internal and external peer organizations and implementing a collaborative approach to all work. Strong processes and policies with supporting tools and templates are paramount to the success of our day-to-day operations, which help to maintain meaningful, long lasting relationships that can be leveraged in the future to support a sustainable fundraising program.

There is a high volume of work requiring strong communication, project management, leadership, consultation, relationship building, facilitation, negotiation and client service skills. The position deals with complex issues, and requires sound judgment and decision-making, and the ability to manage fluid expectations, projects, shifting priorities and deadlines with minimal supervision. The position will work with all levels of institutional leadership and will serve as a mentor to others, providing best-practices authority on institutional naming, signage and recognition. Decisions made by this position will have an impact university wide, stakeholders who are donors and prospective donors, as well as on key external partners (e.g. foundations, corporations, individuals). The impact of error and stress levels are high, and evening and weekend hours are sometimes required.

A strong understanding of the University's mission, values and plans is key, as work often affects internal and external stakeholders including donors, fundraisers, recipient units of gifts. Commitment to accuracy of work and specialized knowledge is critical.

This position is critical to helping realize the Office of Advancement's strategic vision by developing and managing a comprehensive donor recognition program (primarily focused on institutional naming and signage) by administering strategy, structure, priorities, policies and procedures for faculty and staff on campus. The Specialist administers the institution's Philanthropic Naming Policy and Operating Standards and conducts the workflow required for annual review of the policy. This role will govern all philanthropic namings (past and future) while directly working with the Director of Operations to generate naming request submissions and Briefing Notes for Action for the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Governors' approval. The Specialist will ensure recognition opportunities are within scope and alignment with the naming policy and with donor gift agreements, mitigating reputational risk and discrepancies in standard practices at the University.

The Specialist's accountability within the unit has two fundamental goals:


Recognition celebrates and promotes the gifts made to the institution, the donors who have made them, and the impact that they will make or have made as a result. Recognition activities are tied to donor strategy, planned and executed in ways that are meaningful, personal and timely for the donor and strategically support the UCalgary Giving mandate. The Specialist will need to manage and execute strategy and positioning of recognition policies, standards, processes and procedures across campus. Recognition practices will include institutional naming and signage.

Engaging current donors to UCalgary through opportunities and activities that are relevant to stewardship of their relationships with UCalgary. Working closely with faculty-based Advancement staff, the Specialist will be mandated to create a meaningful and streamlined strategy for recognition practices to increase the quality of touch points with current donors.

Leads collaborative meetings with key business units (Campus Architecture, Gift Compliance, Faculty Advancement staff, Communications, etc) to plan effective tactics as part of an overall plan to maintain an excellent donor recognition program.




Position Description




Summary of Key Responsibilities
 (job functions include but are not limited to):


Plan and oversee the short- and long-term components of an integrated donor recognition program that improves accountability and transparency to donors.

Provides strategic and proactive leadership in planning, developing, implementing and continuously improving plans, tools, structures, priorities, policies, procedures and information management relating to the institutional recognition practices across campus. This includes fulfilling donor naming opportunities based on donor gift agreements and ensuring proper follow up and adherence with the Philanthropic Naming Policy.

In partnership with the Director, Stewardship, oversees, influences, supports and complements faculty- and unit-based donor relations programs for a seamless, integrated donor experience.

Responsible for the creation and implementation of recognition plans at both the central and faculty levels and ensuring staff follow best practices and standards. Develop and maintain methods of tracking and reporting on institutional recognition practices using the BBCRM database and Tableau to advance overall recognition touch points.

Administers the effectiveness of policies, procedures and tools with respect to donor recognition, philanthropic naming and institutional signage throughout campus. This includes managing the process for expired namings, governing all future namings with the appropriate stakeholders, conducting an inventory of present-day naming opportunities on campus, leading an audit of all existing institutional namings and liaising with Campus Architecture regarding standardized and relevant donor signage opportunities.

Provide leadership, management and coaching to Advancement staff, with accountabilities for donor recognition, naming and signage.

Train faculty and staff on the Philanthropic Naming Policy and Operating Standards and institutional recognition program and engage them in new processes to enhance the long-term effectiveness of donor relationships.




Qualifications / Requirements




University degree in a related field or a minimum of three years of related experience in fundraising, stewardship and donor recognition and/or communications, in combination with project management.

Understanding of the donor cycle and the importance of communications, recognition and stewardship to that cycle is essential.

Experience with BBCRM is an asset.

Project management experience is essential.

Proven organizational abilities and strong interpersonal skills and must be an innovative thinker with high levels of initiative, energy and enthusiasm.

        Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Aurea Software. Have you got what it takes?

Are you motivated by challenging puzzles and are a driven and creative problem solver?

At Aurea, the Solutions and Services teams leverage multiple Aurea products to solve the complex business problems applicable to a number of customers. These solutions combine our products in new and unique ways, creating seamless software solutions that unlock tremendous business value for our customers. The solutions are not developed or deployed for one-off customers as developed in a typical consulting organization. Instead, it's similar to a software product being delivered to a large customer base.

Unlike a traditional Architect who works on a specific product and on a specific technology, successful candidates in this role will be working on building standard solutions using multiple products for a large customer base. This role does not require expertise in only one language. Instead, it requires the ability to pick up new technologies and ramp up on multiple product frameworks.



What You Will Be Doing




Work with the solution director translates the business use case into the solution storyboard 

Architect and design the technical solution (preparing a technical spec and c4 architecture models)

Guide/mentor developers on implementation and deliver the GA releases to all customers.




What You Won’t Be Doing




You are not involved in Core Product Engineering, will not be working on a specific product and specific technology.

You will not build products from scratch. It is about leveraging existing frameworks and assembling/integrating multiple products to solve a business use-case.




Senior Software Architect Key Responsibilities




You will make business decisions while detailing a storyboard that captures the business value, use case, and user stories/personas delivered by a solution.

You will make architecture decisions that efficiently integrate multiple Aurea products using the Aurea Integration Hub to bring life to the storyboard.

You will make design decisions that strike a balance between reliable, secure, scalable architecture vs the urgency of the business need. Eg. how to build an MVP and evolve it into a fully scalable solution.

You will estimate and derive a WBS while the low-level specifications are still worked upon.




Basic Requirements




great self-learner who has learned new technologies by themself e.g. AWS architecture, Docker, Kubernetes, etc

expert coder in one of the technology stacks - Java, JavaScript, C#,

exposure to AWS architecture, Docker, Kubernetes.




Nice-to-have Requirements




UX / UI - Usability experience and design thinking.

Product management and product ownership exposure

Agile Delivery Methodologies.




About Aurea Software



Aurea was founded with the singular vision of helping businesses succeed in today’s complex digital landscape. To achieve that goal, we do things differently. Our customers enjoy access to every product in our portfolio - all of which are cloud-based, enterprise-scale, and easy to use - with one simple subscription. We focus on relationships instead of transactions. And our unique AureaOne operating model and acquisition strategy ensure that our portfolio continues to grow, so we can continue to provide competitive advantage and differentiated results for our customers no matter what the future holds.

Aurea was an early adopter of remote work. In fact, our entire team of nearly 2,000 people and growing operates in a fully-remote work model.

There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!

Description




Revera is a leading owner, operator and investor in the senior living sector. We offer seniors’ apartments, independent living, assisted living, memory care and long term care. We understand how to create the best experience for people living in a Revera home. We believe everyone should have the opportunity to live a life of purpose, and we create environments that make that possible. 



Our mission is to celebrate the human spirit in every way possible – and that applies to both our residents and our employees. There’s a lot that goes into being a member of our team – and there’s a lot that you’ll get out of the experience too. We go the extra mile to ensure that each member of our staff feels safe, secure, enriched and empowered in their role. So that everyone under our roof is given the opportunity to thrive, grow and make the most of every day. 



Vaccines are a proven, safe and powerful weapon in our battle against COVID-19. Now that vaccines are widely available and recognizing that many of our staff are already vaccinated, vaccination will be a condition of employment for new hires, except when impossible due to legitimate, established exceptions. 

The vaccine must be a 

two-dose COVID-19 

vaccination series approved by Health Canada

.
 
This is one more important step to protect both our residents and staff as we continue to battle this deadly virus.
