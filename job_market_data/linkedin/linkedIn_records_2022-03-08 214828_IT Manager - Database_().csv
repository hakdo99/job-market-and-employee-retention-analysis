Work at CBC/Radio-Canada 



 Behind the scenes, but ahead of the curve: help us develop the next-generation public broadcaster. 


Created in 2021 to align, lighten and modernize infrastructure, Technology &amp; Infrastructure is the backbone and the future-forward arm of CBC/Radio-Canada. We are the people that make stuff work. We make connections; between media content, systems, people and places. We are the space in between.

A place with purpose. CBC/Radio-Canada has always been a highly-regarded pioneer of media technology. Not just in Canada, but around the world. Today, we’re transforming ourselves from conventional radio and television broadcasters into a modern digital media company. Technology is the driving force. T&amp;I is the team making it happen.


 The opportunity 


Reporting to the Senior Manager, Web and Infrastructure, we're looking for a Lead, DevOps to join our growing team.. It’s an opportunity to help shape the way the corporation works internally and make a contribution towards our “Space for us all” strategic plan. As a part of the production solutions team, you will install, monitor and manage critical systems that span multiple platforms across the country.

This is a contract position.



Who Are You And Where Are You Now



You are a DevOps managing the largest news site in Canada and you want to step up to the challenges of working with bigger systems, bigger infrastructure, and bigger demands. Or, you are escaping the old way to work and getting ready to learn new tools, work with exciting digital product teams and be part of a public broadcaster.


 What’s in it for you? 




Skills



In this role, you will continuously be challenged to apply your judgment, knowledge, experience and analytical skills to

Challenges. We spend our days solving problems on an unbelievable scale. Media files are highly nuanced and incredibly complicated; moving our broadcasting content from on-prem servers to the cloud is a complex technical feat. And that’s just the beginning.

Builders who want to be hands-on, who take pride in knowing they are building the next generation of media technology for Canadians.

Cutting-edge tech. CBC/Radio-Canada has a leading-edge tech environment where the team has access to the latest tools and training. This is a rare opportunity to work on a national scale where knowledge acquisition and sharing is part of our culture. It is a versatile, varied and complex infrastructure where you will work with audio, video, French and English languages, corporate infrastructure and internet networking all built into a single ecosystem.


 Why join us? 


CBC/Radio-Canada reflects the Canadian identity and promotes democracy. We strive to represent the diverse voices and regions of the country. We support social and economic innovation. We offer a rare-in-tech work-life balance with an excellent benefits package and a pension plan noted as one of the best in the country; we want to ensure you are happy in and out of the office.

We are a dynamic, in-flux team brimming with potential. We are more than 4 years old and learning to be a new organization within CBC. We want to be a language-independent technology team. There’s a lot of exciting work ahead of us and while we aren’t there yet, we have a plan. We’re a large corporation so sometimes there is red tape; we are looking for people to understand the process and suggest improvements. We’re also a funded organization, which enables us to take actions that contribute to fulfilling our mandate to exceed audience expectations. We weigh our options, research and explore. We take our time evaluating plans when it comes to replacing systems or building critical infrastructure. When those decisions are made, we follow through with purpose. We don’t have one static future ahead of us, but a dynamic, fluid set of options. This means a chance to be part of that change whether you are an idea generator or an executor.

About Us


August is about people. Our partners, our clients and our team make up the lifeblood of our company. We value personal accountability, encourage open, critical thinking and embrace diversity. Most importantly we're interested in how technology can solve the challenges they face.




We help clients across industries adapt and excel in the digital era by offering innovative solutions to challenges across web, mobile, and emerging platforms. Our clients and projects range in scope, industry and size but our commitment to deliver digital solutions to address our customers' needs are a constant.




Full-stack development requires a broad skillset. The best candidates will demonstrate substantial experience within each of the several areas outlined below. Where a 
web developer
 tends to be specialized in either front-end or back-end development, a 

full-stack engineer 

will be proficient across the board, including any associated areas such as database design/management and DevOps.





Full-Stack Developer


The key to exceptional front-end engineering is a thorough understanding of user experience, and in turn, user interface implementation. The latter requires a comprehensive understanding of various front-end technologies, the core being HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is also beneficial for the engineer to be familiar with various frameworks and libraries, but the specific ones are down to personal preference. It’s a bonus to have an appreciation/understanding of product strategy.




Back-end engineering does not require an understanding of user experience, 
per se
. However, it does demand extensive knowledge of API principles. This does not necessarily have to be REST, but in most cases, this is the preferred paradigm. In addition to this, the candidate must excel in at least one back-end technology as well as database design and implementation. It is also important that the candidate holds more than just a basic understanding of managing relevant infrastructure.





The Role


We are looking for a seasoned full-stack engineer to join our growing team. As an integral part of the technical team, S/He will collaborate with a small team of developers and designers, along with the support and direction of the Technical Lead and Project Manager to build great products for our clients. Successful candidates will have a minimum of five years’ recent experience with all of the skills listed below.

Analyze user needs and develop software solutions

Work with the project manager or product owner to meet specification needs

Design and implementation of the overall web architecture

“Pixel-perfect” implementation of our approved user interface

Recommend software upgrades to optimize operational efficiency

Collaborate with other developers to design and optimize code

Create flowcharts and user guides for new and existing programs

Document all programming tasks and procedures

Perform routine software maintenance

Design overall architecture of web applications.

Handle responsive design, accessibility and mobile requirements, leveraging best practices and modern frameworks.

Develop test strategies, design automation frameworks, write unit/integration tests to drive up code coverage, automation metrics, security and data protection

Interact with business partners, teammates, internal users and external users regarding cost estimations, timelines, technical issues, and infrastructure support both pre- and post-production

Utilize disciplined coding practices and concepts to enable agility and delivery of high-quality code that is maintainable and reusable

Update progress daily through Project Management tracking tool (ex. Jira) or Kanban/Agile board.

Design and develop APIs and SDKs for our services or products






Qualifications:



Experience (5+ years) in software development, computer engineering, or other related fields

Experienced (3+ years) with NodeJS, Vue or other back-end programming languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, etc)

Experience (at least 3 years) with ReactJS and other front-end frameworks (advanced JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as AngularJS, KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, DurandalJS etc.)

Experience (5+ years) building on WordPress (NICE TO HAVE)

Database design and management, including being up on the latest practices and associated versions and familiarity with relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server

Knowledge of GIit code versioning

Engagement and exposure to the full software development life cycle

Deadline and detail-oriented

familiarity with CSS preprocessors, bundlers, and associated languages/syntaxes/libraries ( e.g., Sass, Less, and webpack)

Thorough understanding of user experience and possibly even product strategy

Experience implementing testing platforms and unit tests






Perks



A competitive base salary package

Paid time off: vacation, public holidays, office is closed between Christmas and New Years

Full health and dental benefits

Remote Work Policy

Company parties in the summer, winter, and a few fun events in between

Engaging, fun, and casual company culture
