About your team



Your e180 team:


At e180, one of our core values is learning (“Be a knowledge gardener”). We cultivate human potential by enabling our people to learn from one another. We love to create rewarding learning experiences for our employees, clients and our community and want to increase the impact of collaborative learning around the world. We have invented Braindate, our flagship product, which helps people around the world connect with each other and share their knowledge.

Your department:

We’re not your typical sales team. That’s because e180 was founded as a social enterprise, and today, e180 is a certified (and award-winning!) B Corporation. This means that we’ve made a public commitment to leveraging our business to make a measurable difference in the world. Our flagship product, Braindate, has evolved over the years, but our mission remains the same: to transform the way that humans learn. The sales team’s pivotal role is to find and close the right clients and partners to help us do just that.





Your team’s rituals and ways of working together


The Sales team is highly collaborative: we work closely with every team at e180 (Marketing, Experience, Product, Customer Success, Development).

Our weekly meetings are a platform for discussing difficult strategic questions. We value transparency, fluid communication and openness to unexpected collaborations. e180 is ambitious and developing rapidly; the Sales team must follow the pace.

The Sales team is agile and adaptable while new avenues and business sectors perpetually unfold. We’re often remote-friendly, given that e180 is developing internationally, and we are looking for someone who is open to traveling to meet clients face-to-face when it will be possible.





Your Role


Your role as a Sales Manager will be to manage and develop a sales team. The goal of the Sales Manager will be to get maximum productivity out of their sales team by using your extensive sales experience to design Sales Plans to follow, train new and current team members and come up along with HR with improvement plans for under performing employees.

In addition to your managerial responsibilities, you will still be on the front lines negotiating deals with clients and managing key accounts. You will find and communicate to our potential clients how Braindate and other e180 services meet a growing range of real business needs. You'll identify client needs, and work with our e180 team to respond with actionable solutions. Finally, you’ll be closing deals as the qualification process bears fruit, and you’ll nurture that new partnership over time!


Tasks may include:



Hire and Train Sales Team

Create pitches and materials that best reach the target audience

Collaborate with Marketing and Experience team to design plans to attract and retain clients

Maintain a close relationship with existing clients:

Know the assigned clients inside and out and fully understand their use of our services, their objectives and their brand image;

Frequently check in with them to discuss needs, concerns, and satisfaction;

Be the first point of contact if questions or issues arise regarding the service;

Sell clients additional services aligned with e180’s new offers.

Handle Contracts:

Negotiate terms such as price and delivery;

Use the appropriate paperwork when accounts come up for renewal to ensure mutually satisfying arrangements.

Collaborate with other departments to ensure e180’s offer is in line with customer requests.

Network with Potential Clients executives to generate new accounts and business.






Some extra qualities that will set you apart:



Do you have an educational background in Sales Management and Business Development Management? Good, this is what we are looking for!

Do you have significant experience in international business development, sales or even fundraising? In your position, that will be essential!

Are you experienced in the event industry and/or the impact sector? Great, it is a strong asset!

Do you have the ability to work autonomously while eager to contribute to team goals? Awesome! We can’t wait to work together!

Are you eager to build relationships with clients and serve their needs? That’ll be a huge plus!

Are you driven by challenges and result oriented? You will have a significant impact at e180!

Do you have a real desire to learn and grow? You’ll fit right in!






You’ll have the opportunity to further your knowledge about:



Team leading and Managing

Client account acquisition, management and growth;

Using business as a force for good;

Collaborative learning in action;

Event design and participant experience;

Growth and scaling business strategy;

Your own self-directed learning goals!

About Avenue



Avenue is a distributed, fully remote organization. We transitioned to this way of working in 2020 (like everyone else!) but haven’t looked back since and plan to remain so permanently. Asynchronous communication and flexible hours let us schedule our days so we work when we do our best work without missing out on life’s important moments.

Avenue grew out of a need we saw in the real estate industry. All of the REALTORS® we knew put in hours of screen time each week online, trying to manage the many moving parts that made up their personal marketing. They wanted to attract new clients, but they weren’t getting the results they wanted.

As a team of marketers, engineers, and designers, we saw how our respective skill sets could work together to solve their problem. We could give Realtors what they’d never had before: The chance to market themselves online, and stand out—supported by the knowledge and tools only a team of experts could provide.

Today Avenue offers realtors through North America a beautiful semi-custom website aligned with their brand, lead capture tools, lite-CRM, online advertising management and a monthly email newsletter. Giving our clients access to a complete online marketing strategy that was previously only available through high-cost agencies.
