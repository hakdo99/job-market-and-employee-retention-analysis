Are you a collaborative UX Research leader who loves finding answers to complex questions, then tying them into a larger product roadmap? Do you get energized by working collaboratively with UX Designers and product management to define, empathize, ideate, prototype, and test design solutions?




We’re looking for someone to lead our UX Research strategy – someone who has mastery of the UX research process and toolkit. We’d love to hear from you!




What will you be researching?




Blackline designs and manufactures connected hardware (IoT) and software (SaaS) solutions for the industrial safety market. Our suite of products and services is also capable of collecting huge amounts of data, which we analyse and visualize for our customers. All of this to say that you will have a broad range of topics to dive into.




You will work on four main product streams:


Blackline Live (cloud-hosted portal for real-time device fleet management)

Blackline Vision (leveraging safety and productivity data for analytics reporting)

Mobile Applications (iOS and Android apps)

You will be an integral part of building personas and user flows to communicate to the rest of the business, so we know who we are serving.




What makes you a good fit for this position?


You are comfortable with ambiguity but feel compelled to impose structure. There is no shortage of great ideas flying around. Creating processes to triage incoming research requests will help us know what to work on.

You balance creativity and constraint. Some projects are constrained by timelines and budgets, others are blank canvases that are only constrained by the ingenuity we bring to them. We need someone who delights in the research and delivers results.

You are self-directed and flexible. The people who excel at Blackline are great at taking a broad outline of what needs to be done, then figuring out how to do it and making it happen. They regularly check in to ensure projects are still on track and are open to adjusting plans as needed.





We’re looking for a UX Research leader who:


Has a minimum of 5 years of experience in UX research, or a related field, working with industry partners

Can show examples of work that demonstrates your research experience and showcases the result, as well as the process you took to get there

Has great problem-solving skills with an ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise ways

Is eligible to work in Canada or the United States, and is willing to work business hours in the Mountain time zone





We prioritize applicants who have:


Experience building and managing a research program

Experience with physical hardware (IoT) and/or SaaS products

Experience working with UX design, software development, and marketing teams

Experience working at a medium to large business with cross-functional departments

A graduate degree in Design, Psychology, Human Factors, Computer Science, or a related discipline





Benefits And Compensation


Full-time salaried position: compensation to match your experience and talent

Rapidly growing tech company expanding globally

Extended Health and Dental benefits, along with a wellness program

Employee Family Assistance Program

Educational Assistance Program

Company stock purchase plan with up to 50% matching contributions





NOTE: A criminal background check will be required for corporate data access security.




Blackline Safety is powered by the diversity of our talented employees. We are an equal opportunity employer. We consider all applicants, regardless of age, religion, race, color, ancestry, gender, gender identity, disability, national origin, race, and/or sexual orientation. We enthusiastically encourage all individuals to apply for positions that fit their passions. Come join our inclusive team and start collaborating with us on exciting projects!

Senior Data Scientist


Senior Data Scientist 



Our Capital One Data Team.


Data is at the centre of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Senior Data Scientist on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.


A day in the life of a Capital One Senior Data Scientist 


You’ll work alongside a team that’s leading the next wave of change, using the latest in distributed computing technologies to uncover new ways to help everyday people feel confident about credit.



The Ideal Candidate Will Be




Curious: You ask why, you explore, you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You probably know Python, Scala, or Java and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.

A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).

A Stickler for good software: You have a reverence for DevOps and don’t consider any piece of code complete without a thorough testing suite.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.

Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.


Be ready to join a community of the smartest people you’ve ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.

We’re all-in on the cloud and leaders in the adoption of open source, RESTful APIs, microservices, and containers. We build our own products and release them with a speed and agility that allows us to get new customer experiences to market quickly. And, as a founder-led company, we’re inspired to make, break, do, and do good. So, let’s do something great together.



Responsibilities




Writing software to clean and investigate large, messy data sets of numerical and textual data

Integrating with internal and external data sources and APIs to help uncover new trends and improve analysis

Developing highly scalable data pipelines, tools, and products to enable the analyst community to fully leverage the power of AWS

Streamlining the deployment and maintenance of machine learning models by facilitating efficient model updates and creating robust operational monitoring

Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow




Basic Qualifications

At least 1 year of experience with relational databases and programming in SQL

Master’s Degree or PhD

Experience working with AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, etc.)

Understanding of machine learning or predictive models (scikit-learn, H2O, xgboost, or TensorFlow) workflows

At least 3 years’ experience in Python

At least 3 years’ experience with SQL

The Centre for International Peace and Security Studies (CIPSS) at McGill University invites applications for a full-time Post-doctoral Researcher to work as part of an emerging research program on 
Distributional Effects in the Global Economy: Policy Obstacles and Solutions. 



Research Project


Welfare-improving reforms, in areas ranging from trade liberalization and decarbonization policies to Covid-19 policy responses, often generate winners and losers. These distributional consequences can impede the reform themselves, or lead to a backlash against them.

With growing attention paid to economic inequality, the study of distributional effects also raises concerns about how policy change to promote national growth, address climate change, and tackle global pandemics may come at the expense of those who are already most vulnerable.

A growing body of work also speaks to the gap between objective distributional effects and their subjective perception by individuals. The same level of economic harm can lead to political upheaval in some cases but not in others, as it intersects with notions of collective identity and group perceptions of status loss or historical decline.

In response, a range of compensation mechanisms and labor adjustment policies—from Trade Adjustment Assistance in the US to the global “just transition” movement addressing decarbonization—have sought to address these distributional effects. Yet such measures often face considerable political obstacles, and have thus far met with limited success.

The research program on 
Distributional Effects in the Global Economy: Policy Obstacles and Solutions
 is interested in studying the political and economic questions related to the distributional effects of reforms, and putting forth potential policy solutions to these obstacles.


Applicant Profile


This research project welcomes postdoctoral applicants from political science, law, economics, public policy, or related fields who can contribute to the project’s research objectives. Applications from researchers using advanced quantitative methods to analyze large data are especially welcome.

The postdoctoral researcher will interact with a network of scholars in international and comparative political economy, international relations, public policy, and international law across McGill and its partner institutions, the Université de Montréal and Concordia University.



Conditions And Requirements



The start date for the position is 1 September 2022 (or as soon as possible thereafter). The duration is one year, with the possibility of renewal conditional on funding and satisfactory progress. The postdoctoral researcher will receive a salary of $C48,000 per year as well as benefits and a $C4,000 research fund.

The postdoctoral researcher will be expected to be in residence at McGill throughout the academic year, to maintain an active research and publication agenda, and to take full part in the seminars, workshops, and other events that form part of CIPSS. They will be expected to work closely with the CIPSS Director, Professor Jennifer Welsh, Professor Krzysztof Pelc, and Professor Leonardo Baccini, and to help in organizing workshops and grant proposals related to the research project.

There is no teaching requirement associated with the position.

Candidates must have recently been awarded (within 5 years) a PhD or must have been awarded or submitted (oral defense pending) by the start date of 1 September 2022. Knowledge of French is an advantage but not required. The competition is open with respect to citizenship and nationality, but applications should indicate the applicant’s citizenship.

Other information on postdoctoral fellowships at McGill is available at http://www.mcgill.ca/gps/postdocs/fellows , including information on obtaining a Canadian work permit if necessary.


 Application Process 


Applicants should upload a cover letter, CV, research statement and one writing sample of no more than 8-10,000 words as a single document. They should also provide the names of 
two referees
 who will be contacted if the candidate is short-listed.
