They plan and prioritize to meet the goals of their team and the organization through establishing metrics and milestones. They accept responsibility for all success and misses for themselves and their team.





Be Your Best Self


Leaders show up each day ready to model the behaviour they wish to see from others. They actively seek new ways to develop and are not afraid to take risks and try something different. They stretch in order to grow.





Communicate


Leaders are expert communicators. They deliver timely and helpful communications to their team ensuring that all feel connected and in the loop. They understand that different audiences require different messaging and know the best way to deliver a communication based on the setting; one-on-one, small and large groups or among diverse styles and position levels. They actively listen to others and encourage open expression and diverse ideas.

Position Overview



The 
Department of Stewardship 
in the 
Office of Advancement Services
 is currently seeking a Full-time Regular 
Recognition &amp; Engagement Specialist
.

The University of Calgary is Canada's leading next-generation university: a living, growing and youthful institution that embraces change and opportunity with a can-do attitude. Located in the nation's most enterprising city, the University is making tremendous progress on its Eyes High journey to be recognized as one of Canada's top five research universities, grounded in innovative learning and teaching and fully integrated with the community it both serves and leads. The University of Calgary inspires and supports discovery, creativity and innovation across all disciplines.

The Recognition Specialist will embrace achievement of these goals as they apply to celebrating our donors through excellent stewardship and recognition. Reporting to the Director, Stewardship, the successful candidate will contribute to meaningful communications, stewardship and recognition that celebrates new and existing donors; informs and educates future donors; and creates consistency with how we engage UCalgary stakeholders as it relates to philanthropy.

The goal of the Recognition Specialist is to ensure that UCalgary remains relevant and competitive in all aspects of donor recognition and mitigates reputational risk to the institution through rigorous counsel and governance regarding policy and process adherence. This will be achieved through benchmarking, specialized industry awareness, networking with internal and external peer organizations and implementing a collaborative approach to all work. Strong processes and policies with supporting tools and templates are paramount to the success of our day-to-day operations, which help to maintain meaningful, long lasting relationships that can be leveraged in the future to support a sustainable fundraising program.

There is a high volume of work requiring strong communication, project management, leadership, consultation, relationship building, facilitation, negotiation and client service skills. The position deals with complex issues, and requires sound judgment and decision-making, and the ability to manage fluid expectations, projects, shifting priorities and deadlines with minimal supervision. The position will work with all levels of institutional leadership and will serve as a mentor to others, providing best-practices authority on institutional naming, signage and recognition. Decisions made by this position will have an impact university wide, stakeholders who are donors and prospective donors, as well as on key external partners (e.g. foundations, corporations, individuals). The impact of error and stress levels are high, and evening and weekend hours are sometimes required.

A strong understanding of the University's mission, values and plans is key, as work often affects internal and external stakeholders including donors, fundraisers, recipient units of gifts. Commitment to accuracy of work and specialized knowledge is critical.

This position is critical to helping realize the Office of Advancement's strategic vision by developing and managing a comprehensive donor recognition program (primarily focused on institutional naming and signage) by administering strategy, structure, priorities, policies and procedures for faculty and staff on campus. The Specialist administers the institution's Philanthropic Naming Policy and Operating Standards and conducts the workflow required for annual review of the policy. This role will govern all philanthropic namings (past and future) while directly working with the Director of Operations to generate naming request submissions and Briefing Notes for Action for the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Governors' approval. The Specialist will ensure recognition opportunities are within scope and alignment with the naming policy and with donor gift agreements, mitigating reputational risk and discrepancies in standard practices at the University.

The Specialist's accountability within the unit has two fundamental goals:


Recognition celebrates and promotes the gifts made to the institution, the donors who have made them, and the impact that they will make or have made as a result. Recognition activities are tied to donor strategy, planned and executed in ways that are meaningful, personal and timely for the donor and strategically support the UCalgary Giving mandate. The Specialist will need to manage and execute strategy and positioning of recognition policies, standards, processes and procedures across campus. Recognition practices will include institutional naming and signage.

Engaging current donors to UCalgary through opportunities and activities that are relevant to stewardship of their relationships with UCalgary. Working closely with faculty-based Advancement staff, the Specialist will be mandated to create a meaningful and streamlined strategy for recognition practices to increase the quality of touch points with current donors.

Leads collaborative meetings with key business units (Campus Architecture, Gift Compliance, Faculty Advancement staff, Communications, etc) to plan effective tactics as part of an overall plan to maintain an excellent donor recognition program.




Position Description




Summary of Key Responsibilities
 (job functions include but are not limited to):


Plan and oversee the short- and long-term components of an integrated donor recognition program that improves accountability and transparency to donors.

Provides strategic and proactive leadership in planning, developing, implementing and continuously improving plans, tools, structures, priorities, policies, procedures and information management relating to the institutional recognition practices across campus. This includes fulfilling donor naming opportunities based on donor gift agreements and ensuring proper follow up and adherence with the Philanthropic Naming Policy.

In partnership with the Director, Stewardship, oversees, influences, supports and complements faculty- and unit-based donor relations programs for a seamless, integrated donor experience.

Responsible for the creation and implementation of recognition plans at both the central and faculty levels and ensuring staff follow best practices and standards. Develop and maintain methods of tracking and reporting on institutional recognition practices using the BBCRM database and Tableau to advance overall recognition touch points.

Administers the effectiveness of policies, procedures and tools with respect to donor recognition, philanthropic naming and institutional signage throughout campus. This includes managing the process for expired namings, governing all future namings with the appropriate stakeholders, conducting an inventory of present-day naming opportunities on campus, leading an audit of all existing institutional namings and liaising with Campus Architecture regarding standardized and relevant donor signage opportunities.

Provide leadership, management and coaching to Advancement staff, with accountabilities for donor recognition, naming and signage.

Train faculty and staff on the Philanthropic Naming Policy and Operating Standards and institutional recognition program and engage them in new processes to enhance the long-term effectiveness of donor relationships.




Qualifications / Requirements




University degree in a related field or a minimum of three years of related experience in fundraising, stewardship and donor recognition and/or communications, in combination with project management.

Understanding of the donor cycle and the importance of communications, recognition and stewardship to that cycle is essential.

Experience with BBCRM is an asset.
