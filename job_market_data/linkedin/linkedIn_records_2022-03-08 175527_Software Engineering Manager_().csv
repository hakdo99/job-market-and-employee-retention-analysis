Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


You have super powers. Use them for good. We catch bad guys and stop online fraud. It’s fun. It’s hard. It matters. We need you.

Amazon’s Customer Trust and Partner Support (CTPS) team is engaged in a technological arms race: cyber-criminals from across the world continually look for new ways to steal from us and cover their tracks, while we invent new techniques to detect and neutralize them with ever increasing speed and scale.

It’s fun. We don’t just catch the bad guys; we stop crimes before they happen. Remember the ""Minority Report""? It’s just like that. Basically, we predict the future by developing and applying cutting-edge machine learning systems to detect, predict, and prevent online fraud before it happens.

It’s hard. This is Amazon, so of course our services are low latency, high throughput, highly scalable, and failure proof. Our fraud prevention systems are also highly reactive: we process multiple terabytes of data yet notice changes in individual behavior patterns in seconds. Even by Amazon standards, our datasets are massive and our transaction rates impressive, and everything is built with a scrupulous attention to security.

It matters. Amazon is one of the world’s most trusted companies. Consider the implications of losing that trust. Third-party sellers account for nearly half the items purchased on Amazon. This nearly always goes smoothly; but when sellers cheat buyers, everyone loses. Even after we refund their money, buyers are less likely to shop at Amazon in the future. Legitimate sellers lose potential sales and are less likely to sell on Amazon. And of course, the money Amazon pays in refunds and chargebacks goes straight to our bottom line and ultimately results in higher prices for all our customers.

We are looking for a gifted software manager to design the next generation of fraud risk management systems for Amazon.

Amazon is one of the world’s most trusted companies. Help us keep it that way.

COVID-19 Considerations 


We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together.

In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.


Corporate Security Responsibility



Responsibilities


All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Thanks to Apple’s unique integration of hardware, software, and services, engineers here partner to get behind a single unified vision. That vision always includes a deep commitment to strengthening Apple’s privacy policy, one of Apple’s core values. Although services are a bigger part of Apple’s business than ever before, these teams remain small, forward-thinking, and multi-functional, offering greater exposure to the array of opportunities here.

Pourquoi rejoindre notre équipe ?


Notre programme Digital Future est un élément crucial de notre stratégie visant à perturber notre secteur. Dans le cadre de ce programme, nous avons lancé une nouvelle initiative intitulée ""Lighthouse"", qui vise à apporter une valeur ajoutée sans précédent à l'interface conception-construction grâce à l'application de technologies de pointe en matière d'apprentissage automatique et d'intelligence artificielle. Cette vision ambitieuse transformera les résultats pour nos clients, renforcera notre leadership technologique et nous positionnera pour une croissance future.

Nous nous concentrons initialement sur les mégaprojets les plus importants et les plus complexes du portefeuille de SNCL à l'échelle mondiale - les projets figurant sur notre feuille de route de déploiement s'étendent sur toute la planète et représentent certains des projets de conception d'infrastructures les plus complexes au monde. La mise en œuvre de ces projets est complexe, avec plusieurs défis supplémentaires provenant de nos partenariats avec multiple fournisseurs et partenaires de construction.

En tant que Responsable du Déploiement Numérique de Lighthouse, vous serez chargé de diriger une équipe d'Accompagnateurs de Mise en Oeuvre dont la tâche principale, mais complexe, consistera à assurer le déploiement et l'adoption efficaces de notre nouvelle suite d'outils. Ces outils placeront, pour la première fois, les données au cœur de nos livrable, fournissant, à portée de main, des informations fondées sur des données à nos responsables de la conception, de la construction et des projets.

Vous utiliserez vos compétences en matière de leadership pour tirer le meilleur parti de votre équipe, mais vous devrez également vous joindre à plusieurs aspects pratiques, incluant la résolution de problèmes si nécessaire. Il s'agira d'un grand pas pour certaines équipes, et une résistance sera donc probable, mais vous travaillerez en étroite collaboration avec notre responsable du Changement et de l'Adoption pour veiller à ce que les défis liés au changement de l'entreprise, du personnel et des processus puissent être surmontés. Sur le plan tactique, vous serez responsable du déblocage des défis techniques liés au déploiement de Lighthouse, ainsi que toutes implications associe au personnel et au processus qui l'accompagnent.

Le candidat idéal aura une expérience de travail dans des projets d'ingénierie de conception détaillée, de préférence dans le secteur des autoroutes, du nucléaire ou chemins de fer. Un esprit d'analyse et une solide maîtrise de la technologie seront aussi importants que de solides compétences en matière de relations avec les parties prenantes.


Quelle sera votre contribution dans l’équipe ?


Le Responsable du Déploiement Numérique de Lighthouse (DN Manager) est chargé de diriger une équipe de Coachs de Mise en Oeuvre afin d'assurer la configuration efficace et le déploiement ultérieur de la solution Lighthouse dans le portefeuille de projets et de programmes d'une région (par exemple, le Royaume-Uni ou le Canada).

Le responsable DN veillera à ce que notre nouvelle suite d'outils, et les processus correspondants, soient adaptés de manière adéquate pour garantir le fonctionnement du produit sur chaque projet. Chaque situation sera légèrement différente, mais le rôle consistera à transformer la façon dont les projets fonctionnent, ainsi que de convaincre les équipes et les utilisateurs de la nécessité de changer et à les éduquer sur la fonctionnalité du produit - en se faisant le champion de l'utilisation et de l'adoption de la solution.

Le responsable du déploiement de Lighthouse Digital devra :


Être responsable de la gestion de l’équipe de Coachs de Mise en Oeuvre, chacun étant intégré sur un projet au sein du portefeuille de déploiement.

S'engager avec les équipes de projet pendant la mobilisation pour évaluer le niveau de configuration requise pour le déploiement de l'outil Lighthouse.

Travailler avec les équipes de projet pour configurer et mettre en place la suite numérique d'outils à utiliser sur un projet.

Concevoir, créer et administrer la formation d’équipes de projet sur l’utilisation efficace des outils Lighthouse, et fournir un soutien et des conseils continus pour intégrer les nouveaux arrivants.

Identifier les obstacles à l'adoption des outils, les résoudre localement si possible ou les transmettre et les coordonner avec le/la responsable du changement et de l'adoption afin d'obtenir un changement efficace.

S'approprier du processus de feedback, définir un mécanisme permettant une résolution de problèmes réactive et immédiate et avoir une vision plus globale d’améliorations de produit et de cas d'utilisation émergents (y compris la communication de ces derniers à l'équipe de développement de produit).

Si nécessaire, configurer tout processus provisoire nécessaire pour surmonter les obstacles au déploiement.

Assurer le suivi de la qualité et de la cohérence des données nécessaires au fonctionnement de Lighthouse et veiller à ce qu'elles soient maintenues et à ce que le personnel du projet ait été formé à cet égard.

Coordonner avec le/la responsable du changement et de l'adoption pour s'assurer que les changements à venir dans la gouvernance d’SNCL ou les nouvelles normes adoptées ayant un impact sur les outils Lighthouse sont adoptés au niveau du projet.

Why join us? 


Our Digital Future programme is a crucial part of our strategy to disrupt our industry. As part of Digital Future, we have launched a new ‘Lighthouse’ initiative, that aims to deliver unprecedented value at the design-construction interface through application of cutting-edge machine-learning and artificial intelligence technologies. This ambitious vision will transform outcomes for our clients, build our technology leadership and position us for future growth.

Our initial focus is on the largest and most complex mega-projects within the SNCL portfolio globally – projects on our deployment roadmap span the globe and represent some of the most challenging infrastructure design projects in the world. Delivery of these programmes is complex, with extra layers of challenge coming from partnerships with other suppliers and construction partners.

As the Lighthouse Digital Deployment Manager, you will be responsible for leading a team of Implementation Coaches with the single focussed, yet challenging, task of ensuring effective deployment and adoption of our new, and industry leading, suite of tools. These tools will, for the first time, place data at the heart of our delivery, with Design, Construction and Project Managers having data driven insights at their fingertips.

You will leverage your leadership skills to make best use of your team but will also need to get stuck in with the practicalities and problem solve where necessary. This will be a big step for some teams, and resistance will therefore be likely, but you will work closely with our Change &amp; Adoption Lead to ensure business, people and process change challenges can be overcome. Tactically, you will be accountable for unblocking the technical challenges of the software deployment, as well as the people and process changes that go with them.

The ideal candidate will have experience of working in and around engineering detailed design projects, preferably in the Highways, Nuclear or Rail sector. An analytical mindset, and a solid grasp of technology will be as important as strong stakeholder skills.


How will you contribute to the team?


The Lighthouse Digital Deployment Manager (DD Manager) is responsible for leading a team of Implementation Coaches to ensure effective configuration and subsequent go-live deployment of the Lighthouse solution onto the portfolio of projects and programmes within a region (e.g. UK / Canada).

The DD Manager will ensure our new suite of tools, and the corresponding analogue processes, are adequately tailored to ensure the product works in each unique project situation. Each situation will be slightly different, but the role will involve transforming how projects work, and convincing teams and users of the need to change as well as educating them on the functionality of the product – championing the use and adoption of the solution.



The Lighthouse Digital Deployment Manager Will




Be responsible for team management of Implementation Coaches, each aligned to a project within the deployment portfolio

Engage with project teams during mobilisation to assess the amount of configuration required for Lighthouse tool deployment

Work with project teams to configure and set-up the digital suite of tools for use on a project

Design, create and administer training to project teams on how to effectively use the Lighthouse tools, providing ongoing support &amp; guidance to onboard new starters

Identify barriers to early adoption, resolve locally where possible or escalate to and co-ordinate with the Change &amp; Adoption Lead to bring about effective change

Own the user-feedback process, defining a mechanism that allows for reactive problem solving of immediate barriers alongside a more holistic view of product enhancements / emerging use cases (including the communication of these to the product development team for consideration).

As necessary, configure any interim analogue processes needed to overcome tactical hurdles to deployment

Track the data quality and consistency necessary for Lighthouse operation and ensure it is maintained and project staff have been trained on the importance of this

Co-ordinate with the Change &amp; Adoption lead to ensure upcoming changes to SNCL governance or adopted industry standards that impact the Lighthouse tools are adopted at a project level



What will you contribute?




Technical Knowledge &amp; Experience




Hands-on experience operating in a technical or project delivery role in engineering design and/or construction – preferably in the Highways, Nuclear or Rail sector

Experience of all-encompassing change; people, process and systems in a digital environment

Experience designing &amp; facilitating workshops and briefings with stakeholders of all levels

Understanding of key user groups (e.g. design teams, project planners, project controls) and the design delivery lifecycle

Experience using SNCL enterprise platforms, tools, processes and governance would be advantageous (e.g. JDE, Primavera P6, Oracle EBS)

Experience operating under an Agile delivery model, and/or a software development environment would be a benefit but not essential




Individual Skills, Mindset &amp; Behaviours




Excellent communicator, with strong written and verbal communication skills along a desire to work in a cross-functional team (technical and non-technical)

Positive attitude to thrive in a fast-paced environment.

People leader, able to forge strong interpersonal relationships to unite teams, with a willingness to challenge the status-quo and influence for change, even with senior stakeholders

A high-energy and passionate outlook to the role, has a strong sense of ownership and is willing to take responsibility for decision-making and as well as tactical actions

A solid understanding of how people go through a change and the change process would be a benefit but not essential

Basic principles of software solution architecture and the systems and processes needed to deploy a tech-solution would be a benefit but not essential

Accepting of resistance as a reality, with willingness to respond with resilience and flexibility

Able to take a holistic approach to problem solving, and work as part of a team to determine the best solution




What We Offer At SNC-Lavalin



At SNC-Lavalin, you will enjoy competitive compensation, a safe and healthy work environment, and a full range of benefits (ie.: group insurance, retirement savings plan, share purchase plan, continuing education program, etc.).

CloudBees is looking for a Senior Operations Engineer to join the hive in the Engineering Operations team:





Location
: Canada / US East timezone only.





What you’ll be doing




TEAM-BUILDING
 - inside the team and across teams - you’ll be proposing new ideas and helping implement them


THINKING
 - coming up with new ways of solving problems - and working with the team to prove them out and then implement them


DOCUMENTING
 - describing problems, how your proposed solution solves those problems, and how your implemented solutions are operated.


OPTIMIZING
 - working with Engineering teams to optimize their build systems - even our monster jobs (lots of parallelism - lots of bottlenecks - lots of technical challenges)


DEFINING
 - writing / modifying Terraform to handle our infrastructure, and helping teams define their infrastructure using our modules.


CODING
 - you’ll be writing code in Golang - we occasionally write glue in Python / Groovy (but not very often)


SECURING
 - working with our security team to drive operational change in engineering teams - “Supply Chain Integrity” - and drive organizational security changes (logging, auditing, monitoring, alerting)


OBSERVING
 - adding the right monitoring so that we are alerted before our customers notice, and not alerted when the system is able to heal itself


ALERTING
 - getting alerts and working with team members to solve the initial problem, documenting the problem and then working out how to stop them happening again


DEVOPS / DEVSECOPS
 - We’re not “DevOps” engineers, but we do help our teams become more proficient in doing Dev and Ops (and embracing Total Ownership). We build the guard rails to help them do it safely and align tech-stacks across the company.






What you’ll bring to the team



New ideas from where you’ve worked in the past - what worked well, what didn’t work, what CloudBees could do better?

“the knack” - an uncanny ability to uncover the root cause of problems based on limited information because “it feels like something you’ve seen before”

The courage to say - “I’m not sure” - and getting feedback from your colleagues on how to complete a task in our tech-stack

No fear of saying - “Have you considered doing it this way” - and giving constructive feedback to colleagues on alternative ways of doing things

A tireless desire to automate stuff!






What you’ll work on



IaaS - GCP, AWS, a little Azure

Platform tools - Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, Docker

Language tools - Golang

Engineering tools - Jenkins, Vault, Auth0

Operations tools - PagerDuty, DataDog

Corporate tools - OKTA, GSuite, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Slack (we use these - rather than “work on them”)






How you’ll be part of the team



You are:



self-motivated and enjoy solving problems

excited by the opportunity to automate yourself out of recurring work

able to keep tickets up to date, so we don’t need too many status meetings (we’re async first due to our distributed nature)

You will liaise directly with the software engineers across all teams, ensuring that decisions are agreed internally and externally to Operations and that they meet our technical and non-technical objectives.



You have experience in:



programming in various languages and domains

the ""modern Ops stack"" (e.g. monitoring, alerting, cloud-based provisioning, Docker, Kubernetes)

Linux systems administration

cloud-based operations (GCP, AWS, or Azure)

cluster orchestration and management tools (e.g. k8s / AWS ECS / Terraform / etc)

continuous integration / continuous delivery tools (Jenkins / CodeShip etc)

modern software engineering practices: code reviews, unit / acceptance testing, source control, etc.






How you’ll work



You work in a geographically distributed team (APAC, US, EMEA) of peers

You choose your own work in tandem with the team, team-leader, and manager

You report directly to the Operations Manager (who reports to the VP of Engineering)

Your working hours are flexible - while there will be some core hours required for meeting with Engineering and Operations teams - much latitude is given in getting work done. This includes determining your own start and finish times to accommodate family life.

Travel is limited (especially at the moment) - but once things return to normal (whatever that looks like) we’ll have an annual offsite somewhere on the planet

Job Description



Title: Senior Software Engineer



Reports to: Senior Director of Engineering



Location: Anywhere in USA, Canada, or Latin America






Job Summary


As a Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.





Role Context


Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). Earlier this year we acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on their technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.





Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity



Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.

Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC's directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.

Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product &amp; tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.






Job Requirements



5-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, this is a proxy but not a hard requirement)

Back-end experience with Javascript, Python (Django), or Ruby on Rails and front-end experience with React preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.

Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.

Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions

Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.

Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required






Company Information


Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is a global, public company, specializing in organizational performance improvement. We help organizations achieve results that require lasting changes in human behavior. Our world-class solutions enable greatness in individuals, teams and organizations and are accessible through the FranklinCovey All Access Pass® available in multiple modalities and in 21 languages.

116,2959834385,Senior Software Engineer,Full-time,,DAO Exchange,,"Toronto, ON","


We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in the way we collaborate.




Over the past 2-years, fuelled by the necessity of the pandemic, we’ve witnessed offices become accepting of remote work and far flung friends become closer. But over the next decade, fuelled by rapidly developing blockchain infrastructure, we see even greater progress towards diversity and inclusivity : where geographic and stakeholder borders are eviscerated.




Founded in December 2021, we’ve already raised financing from leading blockchain investors, operators, and thinkers, and we’ve established an initial team of 5. We’re on a mission to accelerate this vision for an inclusive future by accelerating the next 1B DAO Participants.




We’re now hunting for a senior full stack software engineer. In this exciting role you’ll own the build of one of our products from conception through scale, work at the forefront of one of the fastest growing and most dynamic technical environments of all-time, and team up with a daring, performing, caring, curious and integrative group of seasoned builders and operators.





You will




Own our Discovery product
. You’ll be building the primary hub that fellow degens will use for discovering, learning, and joining DAOs.


Build across the stack
. You’ll implement and make decisions about the frameworks, protocols, and architecture for that product. You’ll work across the front and back-end, and interact lightly with web3 infrastructure.


Collaborate cross-functionally.
 With support from our Founding Eng Lead, you’ll work closely with Product, Design, Business Development / Operations, and our customers.


Ship fast with long-haul in mind.
 We’re a system in our infancy and so prioritizing speed and learning. You’ll iterate quickly while keeping in mind future scalability requirements.



You are




Truly ‘Senior’
. You’ve been in the industry for 4+ years. You ask “are we building the right thing?” and not just “how do I build this thing?” You have a history of working across the stack and solving complex problems while considering trade-offs between different implementations. You balance speed and control to scope and build stable solutions quickly


A communicator
. Both written and verbal. Grandma doesn’t know what React is, but she defo knows what you’re saying. You’ve been responsible for planning projects and scoping projects for yourself and others, including with PMs to manage scope and timelines for release.


A nerd snipee
. You like to dive deeply into technical matters and form a solid understanding of the space you’re working in. You’ve fallen down the crypto rabbithole.


Compatible
. You’re proficient in Javascript (ideally Typescript or at the very least comfortable with typed languages). You are comfortable with functional concepts in Javascript.  You have experience with ReactJS.



Bonus points!




A degen
. You’ve fallen down the rabbit hole. You say gm despite the time of day.


Proficient with w3 infrastructure
. You have experience writing, deploying, and testing smart contracts and other web3 technologies.


Proficient with application infrastructure
. You have experience deploying and managing application infrastructure



Benefits




Remote first
: You’ll be joining a team based all over the world.


Recognized in the blockchain and Web3 ecosystem
: Working at DAO Exchange is a tremendous reference for your career. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that extends across the global crypto ecosystem.


Equity
: We believe in ownership and want everyone to have a stake in our future success, that’s why you’ll receive equity when you join us.


Continuous learning &amp; opportunities
: We provide ongoing growth and development through on-the-job learning.


Flexible working arrangements
: With our global workforce we have fine-tuned asynchronous working which means we have a lot of flexibility in the structure of when we work and how we work together.

More About Hopper



Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:


 Hopper’s valuation is now over $ 5B . The company’s valuation has more thantripled since early 2020.

 The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

 According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

 Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT.

 The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually

 Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

 Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip.

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


Amazon's Sponsored Products advertising business is one of the fastest growing areas in the company. Have you ever wondered what happens behind that “Sponsored” label you see on Amazon? The Sponsored Products team creates and optimizes the systems that match advertiser demand (ads) with page supply (placements) using a combination of data-driven product innovation, machine learning, big data analytics, and low latency/high-volume. By the time organic search results are ready, we've processed all of the candidate and determined which ones are delivered to the page. We do that billions of times per day, resulting in millions of engagements with products that otherwise might not have been seen by shoppers. The business and technical challenges are significant. Fortunately, we have a broad mandate to experiment and innovate, and a seemingly endless range of new opportunities to build a big, sustainable business that helps Amazon continuously delight all of our customers.

Key job responsibilities

We're looking for an innovative and customer-obsessed, technical Sr. Product Manager who will obsess over your customers and work backwards to take our products to the next level of quality and performance by defining product vision and driving execution for products and features related to ad targeting. You will engage with advertisers, integrators, and partner teams to help formulate your vision, and define the features, goals and metrics that drive a substantial science and team to turn your vision into product. You will tackle challenging problems and coordinate high profile projects across multiple teams to ensure our goals are met. You will use customer anecdotes to find inspiration, obsess over the requirements of the product (including APIs) and use data analysis to confirm your suspicions and support your messaging. You'll contribute to the organizational planning for one of the largest advertising programs on the planet, present to senior executives to evangelize your vision and promote your wins while you build your reputation as a leader.



Characteristics Indicative Of Success In This Role




 Highly analytical: You solve problems in ways that can be backed up with verifiable data. You focus on driving processes, tools, and statistical methods which support rational decision-making.

 Technically fearless: You aren't satisfied by performing 'as expected' and push the limits past conventional boundaries. Your dial goes to '11'.

 Engaged by ambiguity: You're able to explore new problem spaces with unique constraints and non-obvious solutions.

 Team obsessed: You help grow your team members to achieve outstanding results. You've learned that big plans generally involve collaboration and great communications.

 Quality obsessed: You recognize that professional scientists build high quality model development and evaluation frameworks to ensure that their models can provably meet launch criteria, or efficiently iterate in the framework until they do.

 Ambitious: You’re ambitious, yet humble. You recognize that there’s always opportunity for improvement. You use introspection and feedback from teammates and peers to raise the bar.
