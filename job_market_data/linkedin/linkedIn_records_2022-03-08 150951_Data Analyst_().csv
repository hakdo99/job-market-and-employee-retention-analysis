About Us





Initiative is different to other media agencies.




We are not trapped by a legacy structure primarily centered on paid advertising. Instead, we are liberated by a new world structure designed to deliver highly differentiated and highly effective communications strategies for our clients. We’re not the biggest agency in town. So rather than outsize our competitors we must outsmart them. That’s why we’ve built the strongest strategic capability of any agency in the market. Core to this strategic capability is an obsession with culture and how brands can pivot from brand advertising (which is forgettable) to cultural branding (which is memorable). Our new world model is comprised of four central “craft centers” – Client Advice and Management, Strategy, Communications Design and Partnerships. OUR BEHAVIORS Initiative respects that everyone has something unique to contribute to the agency. We are a bunch of eclectic and brilliant misfits with diverse backgrounds that represent the unique fabric of consumers and culture. We want you to be yourself. We want to hear your opinions. We want to see your passion and energy. If you disagree with something you see or hear then speak up. We will never punish or penalize you for bringing something important to our attention. If you believe you can improve something in the agency then speak up. We will always listen to your ideas and suggestions. We will not tolerate harassment, bullying or corporate politics. We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We expect you to be responsible on social media and remember that you represent the agency and should not bring us into disrepute.

Generate dashboards and automate reports that empower teams across the organization to make data-driven decisions.

Grow and maintain impactful relationships with stakeholders of both technical and non technical backgrounds with clear and frequent communication.

Think critically about experimental design and advocate for thoughtful experimentation.




What It Takes To Suceed




BA/BS or graduate degree in a quantitative field (mathematics, statistics, economics etc.)

3+ years of quantitative industry experience, ideally within the consumer product space

Excellent SQL skills, fluency in Python, and experience with at least one statistical package (R, Pandas/NumPy/SciPy/matplotlib, Stata, Matlab).

Solid understanding of statistical inference, experimental design and analytic bias. Familiarity with financial modeling and advanced statistics (regression, non parametrics, predictive modeling) a plus.


Local businesses are turning to Yelp because we’re uniquely positioned to help them reach their customers during these challenging times. Our Engineering &amp; Product teams have responded by quickly identifying their needs and building innovative products and features to support them. Our commitment to connecting people with great local businesses has never been stronger.

More About Hopper



Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:


 Hopper’s valuation is now over $ 5B . The company’s valuation has more thantripled since early 2020.

 The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

 According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

 Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT.

 The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually

 Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

 Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip.

 The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.


All this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!

115,2959245613,Senior Operations Engineer,Full-time,,CloudBees,,Canada,"


CloudBees is looking for a Senior Operations Engineer to join the hive in the Engineering Operations team:





Location
: Canada / US East timezone only.





What you’ll be doing




TEAM-BUILDING
 - inside the team and across teams - you’ll be proposing new ideas and helping implement them


THINKING
 - coming up with new ways of solving problems - and working with the team to prove them out and then implement them


DOCUMENTING
 - describing problems, how your proposed solution solves those problems, and how your implemented solutions are operated.


OPTIMIZING
 - working with Engineering teams to optimize their build systems - even our monster jobs (lots of parallelism - lots of bottlenecks - lots of technical challenges)


DEFINING
 - writing / modifying Terraform to handle our infrastructure, and helping teams define their infrastructure using our modules.


CODING
 - you’ll be writing code in Golang - we occasionally write glue in Python / Groovy (but not very often)


SECURING
 - working with our security team to drive operational change in engineering teams - “Supply Chain Integrity” - and drive organizational security changes (logging, auditing, monitoring, alerting)


OBSERVING
 - adding the right monitoring so that we are alerted before our customers notice, and not alerted when the system is able to heal itself


ALERTING
 - getting alerts and working with team members to solve the initial problem, documenting the problem and then working out how to stop them happening again


DEVOPS / DEVSECOPS
 - We’re not “DevOps” engineers, but we do help our teams become more proficient in doing Dev and Ops (and embracing Total Ownership). We build the guard rails to help them do it safely and align tech-stacks across the company.






What you’ll bring to the team



New ideas from where you’ve worked in the past - what worked well, what didn’t work, what CloudBees could do better?

“the knack” - an uncanny ability to uncover the root cause of problems based on limited information because “it feels like something you’ve seen before”

The courage to say - “I’m not sure” - and getting feedback from your colleagues on how to complete a task in our tech-stack

No fear of saying - “Have you considered doing it this way” - and giving constructive feedback to colleagues on alternative ways of doing things

A tireless desire to automate stuff!






What you’ll work on



IaaS - GCP, AWS, a little Azure

Platform tools - Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, Docker

Language tools - Golang

Engineering tools - Jenkins, Vault, Auth0

Operations tools - PagerDuty, DataDog

Corporate tools - OKTA, GSuite, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Slack (we use these - rather than “work on them”)






How you’ll be part of the team



You are:



self-motivated and enjoy solving problems

excited by the opportunity to automate yourself out of recurring work

able to keep tickets up to date, so we don’t need too many status meetings (we’re async first due to our distributed nature)

You will liaise directly with the software engineers across all teams, ensuring that decisions are agreed internally and externally to Operations and that they meet our technical and non-technical objectives.



You have experience in:



programming in various languages and domains

the ""modern Ops stack"" (e.g. monitoring, alerting, cloud-based provisioning, Docker, Kubernetes)

Linux systems administration

cloud-based operations (GCP, AWS, or Azure)

cluster orchestration and management tools (e.g. k8s / AWS ECS / Terraform / etc)

continuous integration / continuous delivery tools (Jenkins / CodeShip etc)

modern software engineering practices: code reviews, unit / acceptance testing, source control, etc.






How you’ll work



You work in a geographically distributed team (APAC, US, EMEA) of peers

You choose your own work in tandem with the team, team-leader, and manager

You report directly to the Operations Manager (who reports to the VP of Engineering)

Your working hours are flexible - while there will be some core hours required for meeting with Engineering and Operations teams - much latitude is given in getting work done. This includes determining your own start and finish times to accommodate family life.

Travel is limited (especially at the moment) - but once things return to normal (whatever that looks like) we’ll have an annual offsite somewhere on the planet

Its work is guided by the Strategy, which was refreshed for 2019 to 2029 and will help drive measurable change for all Canadians affected by cancer and a future where fewer people get cancer, more people survive cancer and those living with the disease have a better quality of life.




The Partnership works with those on the front lines of cancer care, and people living with the disease, to make system-level changes that improve all aspects of the cancer continuum from prevention, screening and diagnosis through to treatment, clinical care, palliative care and survivorship. Partners include provincial and territorial governments, cancer agencies, health organizations, health-care professionals, people living with cancer and those who care for them, as well as First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities, governments and organizations.




The Partnership’s work is guided by a commitment to reducing inequities in cancer care for underserviced people in Canada such as those living in rural and remote areas, those with low income and new immigrants, and addressing First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples-specific cancer control priorities and actions, outlined in the Strategy, reflecting Canada’s commitment to reconciliation.




The Partnership is funded by Health Canada. Learn more about the impact being made by the Partnership with partners across Canada at: www.partnershipagainstcancer.ca.




The Partnership’s Cancer Systems, Performance and Innovation Division drives improvements in Canada’s cancer system through data, research, economic modelling and innovations such as digital healthcare. This division monitors emerging health technologies and leverages data systems to determine gaps and opportunities for improvements in cancer care and informs internal partners on innovative approaches, international best practice and compelling evidence to support key partnership decision making. The division enhances regional integration, with leads located across the country with the mandate of increasing responsiveness to local cancer care needs and opportunities. This division also leads data collection, analysis and reporting to Canadians on the performance of the cancer system and progress of the Partnership and its partners in delivering on the eight priorities of the 2019-2029 Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control.

About Us


August is about people. Our partners, our clients and our team make up the lifeblood of our company. We value personal accountability, encourage open, critical thinking and embrace diversity. Most importantly we're interested in how technology can solve the challenges they face.




We help clients across industries adapt and excel in the digital era by offering innovative solutions to challenges across web, mobile, and emerging platforms. Our clients and projects range in scope, industry and size but our commitment to deliver digital solutions to address our customers' needs are a constant.




Full-stack development requires a broad skillset. The best candidates will demonstrate substantial experience within each of the several areas outlined below. Where a 
web developer
 tends to be specialized in either front-end or back-end development, a 

full-stack engineer 

will be proficient across the board, including any associated areas such as database design/management and DevOps.





Full-Stack Developer


The key to exceptional front-end engineering is a thorough understanding of user experience, and in turn, user interface implementation. The latter requires a comprehensive understanding of various front-end technologies, the core being HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is also beneficial for the engineer to be familiar with various frameworks and libraries, but the specific ones are down to personal preference. It’s a bonus to have an appreciation/understanding of product strategy.




Back-end engineering does not require an understanding of user experience, 
per se
. However, it does demand extensive knowledge of API principles. This does not necessarily have to be REST, but in most cases, this is the preferred paradigm. In addition to this, the candidate must excel in at least one back-end technology as well as database design and implementation. It is also important that the candidate holds more than just a basic understanding of managing relevant infrastructure.





The Role


We are looking for a seasoned full-stack engineer to join our growing team. As an integral part of the technical team, S/He will collaborate with a small team of developers and designers, along with the support and direction of the Technical Lead and Project Manager to build great products for our clients. Successful candidates will have a minimum of five years’ recent experience with all of the skills listed below.





Responsibilities:



Analyze user needs and develop software solutions

Work with the project manager or product owner to meet specification needs

Design and implementation of the overall web architecture

“Pixel-perfect” implementation of our approved user interface

Recommend software upgrades to optimize operational efficiency

Collaborate with other developers to design and optimize code

Create flowcharts and user guides for new and existing programs

Document all programming tasks and procedures

Perform routine software maintenance

Design overall architecture of web applications.

Handle responsive design, accessibility and mobile requirements, leveraging best practices and modern frameworks.

Develop test strategies, design automation frameworks, write unit/integration tests to drive up code coverage, automation metrics, security and data protection

Interact with business partners, teammates, internal users and external users regarding cost estimations, timelines, technical issues, and infrastructure support both pre- and post-production

Utilize disciplined coding practices and concepts to enable agility and delivery of high-quality code that is maintainable and reusable

Update progress daily through Project Management tracking tool (ex. Jira) or Kanban/Agile board.

Design and develop APIs and SDKs for our services or products






Qualifications:



Experience (5+ years) in software development, computer engineering, or other related fields

Experienced (3+ years) with NodeJS, Vue or other back-end programming languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, etc)

Experience (at least 3 years) with ReactJS and other front-end frameworks (advanced JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as AngularJS, KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, DurandalJS etc.)

Experience (5+ years) building on WordPress (NICE TO HAVE)

Database design and management, including being up on the latest practices and associated versions and familiarity with relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server

Knowledge of GIit code versioning

Engagement and exposure to the full software development life cycle

Deadline and detail-oriented

familiarity with CSS preprocessors, bundlers, and associated languages/syntaxes/libraries ( e.g., Sass, Less, and webpack)

Thorough understanding of user experience and possibly even product strategy

Experience implementing testing platforms and unit tests






Perks



A competitive base salary package

Paid time off: vacation, public holidays, office is closed between Christmas and New Years

Full health and dental benefits

Remote Work Policy

Company parties in the summer, winter, and a few fun events in between

Engaging, fun, and casual company culture

Tu te demandes ce qu’est BIM Track?


Excellente question! Voici une petite histoire pour t’aider à mieux comprendre. Une personne est chargée de mener à bien un projet de construction énorme et complexe. Les plans du bâtiment se trouvent dans une maquette 3D (BIM) qui recouvre toutes les différentes parties du projet, comme les systèmes électriques, mécaniques, de plomberie, la maçonnerie, etc., etc. Le problème est que tous les participants à un projet de construction BIM ne sont pas des experts en BIM. Les logiciels de modélisation sont complexes. Sans un produit comme BIM Track, nos clients potentiels sont constamment en train d'extraire des piles de courriels, de feuilles de calcul et de notes de réunion, en se posant des questions telles que : Qui va résoudre le problème de conception? Quelle est l'importance de ce problème ? De quoi avons-nous convenu ? C'est là que notre produit vient sauver la situation... En résumé, BIM Track permet une meilleure coordination et une meilleure coordination permet de meilleurs bâtiments. 




Nous sommes impatients d'avoir de tes nouvelles et d'apprendre à te connaître !

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is storage for the Internet. Through the use of pioneering techniques in storage &amp; computing, customers can reliably store their data on Amazon’s proven computing infrastructure to achieve virtually limitless storage capacity at minimal cost. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that enables customers to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere in the world. It provides all customers with access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to the customers.

This position is for the S3 Replication team in Vancouver, Canada. Customers use replication to make copies of their S3 objects in AWS regions. The Replication Time Control, a feature of the S3 Replication, provides a predictable replication time backed by a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The S3 Replication helps customers meet compliance or business requirements for replication and provides visibility into the replication process with new Amazon CloudWatch Metrics. You will focus on the challenges of writing software to handle the vast array of S3 use cases, with performance being the central binding theme. You will brainstorm new experiences with customers that break ground in enabling new enterprise workloads on S3. You will mentor a group of engineers to build solutions that impact a wide range of customers with a focus on standards in coding, testing, and delivery. The applicant for this role possesses solid analytical and problem-solving skills. The ability to translate technical requirements through all the levels of the software stack is essential. If this sounds like you, come join us and help AWS continue to write the cloud computing story for the industry.

Work-life Balance: Our team works together to provide work/life balance for all team members. We recognize that the circumstances of our team members vary, and we balance work across the team so we’re all able to maintain standards on behalf of our customers, while allowing for rich and happy personal lives.

On-Call Responsibility: S3 services are highly available, but sometimes we occasionally stray away from our normal operations. To minimize the impact of such excursions, we have on-call rotations. However, we set these up so there are focused time periods when you are on-call and when you are not, so you can focus on your day job when not on-call.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth: We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level, etc. You can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. Besides formal mentors, we work and train together, so we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Inclusive Team Culture: We have a diverse team and drive towards an inclusive culture and work environment. Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Our team members are active in Amazon’s 10+ affinity groups, sometimes known as employee resource groups, which bring employees together across businesses and locations around the world. These range from groups such as the Black Employee Network, Amazon Women and Engineering, and LGBTQ+

Key job responsibilities


 You design, implement, test, deploy and maintain innovative software solutions to transform service performance, durability, cost, and security.

 You invent on customers' behalf and solve difficult problems generating positive feedback.

 You are able to work independently and with your team to deliver software successfully.

 You focus on operational excellence, constructively identifying problems and proposing solutions, taking on projects that improve your team’s software, making it better and easier to maintain.

 You make improvements to your team’s development and testing processes.

 You take ownership and do what it takes to get the job done.

 You train and mentor new team-mates about your customers, what your team’s software does, how it is constructed, tested, operates, and how it fits into the bigger picture.


A day in the life

A day in the S3 Replication SDE (Software Development Engineer) life starts with customer obsession, thinking about customers and inventing on their behalf. You dedicate time every day to designing and implementing new functionalities and products, improving operational excellence, optimizing system performance and scaling limits and mentoring others to grow in their roles.

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:


 Hopper’s valuation is now over $ 5B The company’s valuation has more than tripled since early 2020.

 The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

 The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually

 Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

 Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip.

 The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.


All this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)



 Requirement 



Global Affairs Canada (GAC) requires the professional services of one (1) Business Analyst Level 3 under the Task Based Informatics Professional Services Supply Arrangement (TBIPS).


 Background The mandate of Global Affairs Canada (GAC) is to manage Canada's diplomatic and consular relations and development assistance and to encourage the country's international trade. GAC is head quartered in Ottawa, and maintains a presence throughout Canada through regional offices and a network of trade commissioners working in International Trade Offices across the country. Outside Canada, GAC operates an extensive network of missions (embassies, high commissions, and consulates), honorary consulates, and other representational offices.



The spread and complexity of Canada’s representation abroad has a profound impact on the nature and scope of the Department’s Information Management (IM) and Information Technology (IT) environment. The design, implementation and operation of IM/IT services are affected by the extent to which Canada’s employees working abroad are spread around the world; by the enormous differences encountered in diverse public infrastructures and technologies available internationally; and by the competing interests of host countries. Numerous employees at missions are locally-engaged, bringing a variety of cultural, linguistic and security complexities to daily operations abroad.

The international environment in which GAC carries out its mandate has always been extremely challenging. IM/IT is deployed in settings which are geographically dispersed, structurally inconsistent, frequently hazardous, and disrupted by unexpected events both natural and man-made. Regardless, it is imperative to provide an extensive and effective worldwide communications and information sharing platform for all GAC clients and stake holders worldwide.


 Scope of Work 



GAC is undertaking a transformation to provide a transformative Digital workspace. In support of this initiative, GAC will be migrating GAC’s Electronic Document and Records Management (EDRMS) solutions ( InfoBank , SGDE-EDRMS, iRIMS ) to the GoC EDRMS Enterprise solution, GCdocs , or SharePoint, or a combination of both. The initial phase of this project focuses on the migration of Classification Structures and Physical Objects to GCdocs , and the next phase will be the migration of the Documents (electronic files) from both the EDRMS solutions and shared drives to GCdocs / SharePoint.

The Information Management and Technology (IM/IT) Bureau at GAC requires the professional services of one (1) Senior Business Analyst – Level 3 to work on-site on Information Management projects and operational initiatives and be the Lead in the migration of GAC’s EDRMS solutions to GCdocs / SharePoint.


 Tasks and Deliverables

 Tasks 



As directed by the Project Authority and under the direction of the Business and Technical Leads, the consultant will be tasked to perform the following:


 Analysis of the Legacy Records Management system functionality to provide direct mappings, or recommend work around, to similar functionality in GCdocs – Physical Objects. 

 Analysis and standardization of metadata in baseline and custom database fields to provide appropriate mapping to GCdocs – Physical Object fields, and GCdocs or SharePoint for electronic files. This will require the Business Analyst to provide detailed requests to the Data Base Engineer (DBE) to produce custom reports on metadata. The reports will be analyzed to produce required change requests for acceptance by the Records Managers team. 

 Analysis and modification of Classification structures to prepare for export / import into GCdocs Classifications to support Physical Objects or to GCdocs or SharePoint for electronic files. This will require the Business Analyst to provide detailed requests to the Data Base Engineer (DBE) to produce custom reports on Classification metadata. The reports will be analyzed by the Business Analyst to produce other reports on required and or recommended changes. 

 The Business Analyst will conduct meetings with the IM / RM teams to review and discuss required changes in support of the migration, and document acceptance of all change requests. Knowledge of the Legacy Classification Structures, RICS and DRATS is a definite asset to complete this task. 

 The Business Analyst will produce detailed requirements in support of the change requests, to the Data Base Engineer, to be used to create scripts to apply changes for the required changes prior to the export for migration. The Business Analyst will review these change requests to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the changes made by the scripts. 



The proposed resource will also perform some, or all of the following tasks:


 Evaluate business processes, define requirements, uncover areas for improvement and develop and implement solutions. 

 Perform requirements analysis. 

 Gather critical information from meetings with various stakeholders and produce useful documentation to support future development and testing of the solutions. 

 Document and communicate the results of your efforts. Gain consensus as required. 

 Effectively communicate your insights and plans to cross-functional team members and management. 

 Ensure that solutions meet business needs and requirements. 

 Conduct meetings and presentations to share ideas and findings. 

 Serve as liaison between stakeholders and users. 

 Monitor deliverables and ensure timely completion of projects. 

 Provide leadership, training, coaching and guidance to junior staff. 

 Prioritize initiatives based on all business needs and requirements. 

 Deliverables: 



Deliverables requested in support of the migration and IM / RM activities may include, but are not limited to:


 Business Requirements documents (functional, information, security) 

 Options analysis documents 

 Business case documents 

 Business process documents 

 Performance measurement reports 

 Gap analysis documents 

 Process improvement recommendations documents 

 Change and impact analysis documents 

 Presentations 

 Status reports 

 Completion of Business Intake Forms BIF (for software) 

 Completion of Initiative Request Forms IRF 

 Business Case documents (for others) 

 Completion of COTS/SaaS Intake Forms (TBD) 



Additionally, Monthly Status Reports will be provided to the Project Authority indicating project status.

Documentation is to be prepared and submitted using Microsoft suite of applications and tools, unless otherwise specified.


 IM / RM ENVIRONMENTS 

 RDIMS ( eDOCS ) Solutions: InfoBank , SGDE-EDRMS 

 GCdocs Enterprise Solution 

 Teams / SharePoint 

 Shared Drives (ELF – Enterprise Level Folders) 

 Location of Work 



The office / work location is on GAC premises located at 4200 Labelle, but the contractor may also be required to work off-site as situations require (e.g. Covid ). Access to IM/IT systems and infrastructure to work onsite and remotely will be made available as required.

The contractor is required to attend meetings and will perform activities at GAC and may be asked to attend meetings at other GAC offices and partner departments (e.g. PSPC, SSC, TBS) in the National Capital Region and is responsible for his / her own transportation and related expenses. Whenever possible, the contracto r shall attend these meetings virtually.

Slack's backend services are written in Go and Java, and Slack's API is built on 
 PHP/Hack
 . Our 
 data infrastructure

 Whiteboard a fix to a scaling or reliability problem, then make it happen. 

 Write, review, or provide feedback on a technical design proposal from other infrastructure teams. 




You may be a fit for this role if you:





 Have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience. 

 Have built large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on. 

 Have built reliable, safe distributed systems and understand the engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either. 

 Work on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture. 

 Love to model modern methodologies for unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built 

 Are curious, inquisitive, and determined to fix things when they break.

 Experience with Kubernetes 



 Edge Services is a diverse and inclusive team that is quickly growing and building the future of Slack’s infrastructure. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each other’s growth and it’s not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas from the beginning. 



 Come join us! 


Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day.

The AWS Partner Systems team is responsible for external and internal supporting Partner Sales, the APN, and other elements driving the AWS partner ecosystem.

You will build highly secured, scalable, extendable, and performant solutions. Working closely with product and tech teams. You will design, build, test, iterate and deploy new features, system integrations, enhancements to existing features, and provide operational support. You'll play a leading role in code reviews, guiding junior resources towards better designs and clean, standardized coding.

Work/Life Harmony

Our team puts a high value on work-live harmony. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. Our team is located in the Seattle office but we're flexible when team members need to occasionally work from home. We generally keep core in-office hours from 10am - 5pm. About half of us come in earlier and the other half of us stay later.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship.

We care about your career growth. We try to assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Company Description



Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.



Job Description

You will be part of a team who partners closely with other mobile platform teams to support the entire mobile development lifecycle as well as all the mobile product engineering teams. This is a high force multiplier, cross-functional team aiming to enhance the development experience for all mobile developers within Square.



You Will

Develop tooling and metrics to understand what is being tested and how it is tested.

Maintain and optimize the infrastructure to run tests both locally and on CI.

Create and evangelize processes to help enforce test quality.

Own the success of your team's projects, and deliver quantifiable results.

Work with world-class, experienced, and dedicated engineers.




Qualifications




Have at least 3+ years of experience working in the iOS ecosystem.

Be proficient in Objective-C or Swift for development (we use both).

Enjoy working on mobile apps at all levels – from networking up to user interfaces and whatever's in between.

Respond to customer feedback to improve our frameworks and tools.

Have an eagerness to share your ideas, and openness to those of others.

Quickly and easily articulate issues and what needs to be done to resolve them

Objet de l’emploi (Ingénieur Système ICC en Autorité de Conception)


Le but est d’accomplir un mandat d'Ingénieur Système ICC (Integrated Control Center) en Autorité de Conception (Design Authority) dans le cadre de différents projets ICC qui fournissent généralement un système ICC composé d'au moins un produit ICONIS et d'au moins l'un des sous-systèmes suivants : SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), ATS (Automated Train Supervision) et MSM (Maintenance and Security Management).

Il est important de mentionner que l'Ingénieur Système ICC en Autorité de Conception, devra combiner un rôle de leadership avec un rôle technique, d’un côté, coordonner plusieurs Ingénieurs Système pour assurer la conformité de la solution Système à travers les Sous-Systèmes et autres composants, d’un autre, assurer la correspondance entre les spécifications (requis) et les descriptions de contexte opérationnel ainsi que leur conformité aux besoins et attentes du Client, tout en gardant un nombre minime de spécificités projet (en anglais, GAP).

Dans une première phase, l'Ingénieur Système ICC en Autorité de Conception, participera à la définition des spécifications détaillées du projet RER. Dans une deuxième phase, correspondant aux étapes ultérieures du projet RER ou d’autres projets futurs, son mandat sera étendu à un rôle complet d'Ingénieur Système ICC en Autorité de Conception, tel que décrit ci-dessous.


Contexte:


Chez Alstom, un ingénieur système ICC est généralement impliqué au début et à la fin du cycle de développement en V d'Alstom, plus précisément pendant les phases de spécification et d'architecture du système, d'intégration et de validation, d'un projet ICC donné. Une autre partie importante du mandate consiste à examiner la documentation des sous-systèmes et à fournir un soutien aux équipes des sous-systèmes pour assurer la cohérence des sous-systèmes avec l'ensemble du système. L'Ingénieur Système ICC en Autorité de Conception doit, en plus, assumer la responsabilité de la solution globale.

Le Projet RER vise à livrer un ICC basé sur un Système composé de plusieurs sous-systèmes tels que : Système de Contrôle de Trafic qui est en fait un ATS (Supervision Automatique des Trains), SCADA (Contrôle de Supervision et Acquisition de Données), MS (Système de Gestion des incidents), SIM (SIMulation environment), IPS (Integrated Playback System), GCS (Global Common Services) qui est en fait un middleware.

Étant donné qu’à l’état courant du projet RER les requis Système ainsi que l’architecture globale sont définis à un très haut niveau, le but principal de l’Équipe Système sera de les détailler davantage, de confirmer la fonctionnalité finale et d’ajouter les détails de conception (design) nécessaires.

À terme, dans le cadre des étapes suivantes du projet RER ou dans le cadre de projets ICC ultérieurs, l'Ingénieur Système ICC en Autorité de Conception, assumera un ensemble complet de responsabilités, telles que définies ci-dessous.


Objectifs


Coopérer avec d’autres Ingénieurs Système pour assurer la cohérence de la solution système à travers les Sous-Systèmes et autres composants.

Conseiller et participer aux activités d’architecture système

Purpose of the Job


To fulfill an ICC (Integrated Control Center) Design Authority System Engineer mandate within the context of different ICC Projects which typically deliver one ICC System consisting of at least one ICONIS Product and at least one of the following subsystems: SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), ATS (Automated Train Supervision) and MSM (Maintenance and Security Management).

It is important to mention that the Authority Design System Engineer combines a leadership role with a technical one, the first one including coordination of other System Engineers in order to ensure consistency of the system solution across subsystems and other components while the technical one aiming to ensure that specifications and operational context descriptions are consistent, meet the customer’s needs and expectations (within the context of the contract) while minimizing the product gaps.

In a first phase, the ICC Design Authority System Engineer will participate in detailed specification definition on the RER Project. In a second phase, the mandate will be to perform a complete ICC Design Authority System Engineer role in subsequent phases of RER or other subsequent ICC Projects, as described below.

Context:


At Alstom, an ICC System Engineer is typically involved at the beginning and at the end of Alstom’s development Vee-cycle, more precisely during the system specification &amp; architecture, integration and validation phases of a given ICC Project. Another important part of the mandate is to review subsystem documentation and provide support to subsystem teams to ensure consistency of subsystems with the overall system. On top of all that, the Design Authority System Engineer, has the responsibility of the overall solution.

The RER Project is aiming to deliver an ICC based on a System consisting of several subsystems, as follows: Traffic Control System which actually is an ATS (Automatic Train Supervision), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), MS (Management System), SIM (SIMulation environment), IPS (Integrated Playback System), GCS (GTCS Common Services) which is actually a middleware.

Since, at the present state of the RER Project, the System requirements and the System architecture are still at a very high-level, the entire focus of the System Team in the following two years will be to detail further the initial requirements, to confirm final functionality and to follow up with the necessary design.

Eventually, within the following stage of the RER project or during subsequent ICC Projects, the ICC Design Authority System Engineer will be required to assume a complete set of responsibilities, as defined below.

 Context: 


At Alstom, an ICC System Engineer is typically involved at the beginning and at the end of Alstom’s development Vee-cycle, more precisely during the system specification &amp; architecture, integration and validation phases of a given ICC Project. Another important part of the mandate is to review subsystem documentation and provide support to subsystem teams to ensure consistency of subsystems with the overall system. The ICC ATS System Engineer focuses on ATS Subystem but also participates to ATS-related System activities.

The RER Project is aiming to deliver an ICC based on a System consisting of several subsystems, as follows: Traffic Control System which actually is an ATS (Automatic Train Supervision), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), MS (Management System), SIM (SIMulation environment), IPS (Integrated Playback System), GCS (GTCS Common Services) which is actually a middleware.

About Netskope



Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

Company Description



Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Operate and enhance highly scalable microservices consumed by millions of devices across several international markets

Collaborate with multiple stakeholders across the company including product, design, legal, support, and other engineering teams

Provide design reviews for engineering teams across Square working with our frameworks

Of course that comes with a relocation package, but we also want you to be able to enjoy the perks that the Okanagan has to offer (extensive wineries, world-renown ski hills, and sandy beaches anyone?) without breaking the bank. This is why we offer a 10% top up once you are relocated.

        We’re Coinbase. We’re the world’s most trusted way to join the crypto revolution, serving more than 89 million accounts in more than 100 countries.

Our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web 3.0 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.


Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:



You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there. 

You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0. 

You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.

You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.

You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone. 


Coinbase is seeking Staff Software Engineers (Frontend) to join our Risk Platform team.

About Netskope



Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

Senior Data Scientist


Senior Data Scientist 



Our Capital One Data Team.


Data is at the centre of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Senior Data Scientist on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.


A day in the life of a Capital One Senior Data Scientist 


You’ll work alongside a team that’s leading the next wave of change, using the latest in distributed computing technologies to uncover new ways to help everyday people feel confident about credit.



The Ideal Candidate Will Be




Curious: You ask why, you explore, you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You probably know Python, Scala, or Java and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.

A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).

A Stickler for good software: You have a reverence for DevOps and don’t consider any piece of code complete without a thorough testing suite.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.

Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.


Be ready to join a community of the smartest people you’ve ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.

We’re all-in on the cloud and leaders in the adoption of open source, RESTful APIs, microservices, and containers. We build our own products and release them with a speed and agility that allows us to get new customer experiences to market quickly. And, as a founder-led company, we’re inspired to make, break, do, and do good. So, let’s do something great together.

Job Description



About The Team and Our Work


Our status as a world-class VFX facility has been achieved through the development of industry-leading software which empowers our artists to create stunning imagery. We have curated a considerable portfolio of off-the-shelf and in-house software to meet these unique requirements, and continue to evolve and improve our technology as new needs emerge. The Core Engineering team operates within a larger R&amp;D division to provide the business critical infrastructure that enables multiple projects with thousands of shots to be simultaneously completed across the globe efficiently and to the highest quality.

A blend of globally distributed software, systems and operations experts, we are responsible for building and maintaining key infrastructure and services in collaboration with site-local engineering teams and other specialized development teams. With users in all areas of the company, our solution (the Core Platform) is based on a distributed micro-services environment providing capabilities in areas such as compute, storage, sync, and digital asset management. Development and operational support spans the stack from operating system through to desktop/web application front-ends.

In recognition of the flexibility, scalability and maturity of the Core Platform that has been created by the team for MPC, we have been tasked with establishing the Core Platform elsewhere, making it available to other business units that are part of Technicolor’s portfolio.


About The Role


The Compute team is responsible for overseeing implementation of the global Technicolor FEV compute initiatives, around the various on-prem and in-cloud compute resources and their use. Compute developers are responsible for the implementation of projects and products that solve the global render and compute problem, providing exceptional business value.

The Core Platform has a broad scope and diverse user group. While there is some expectation of the role to work across multiple aspects of the platform (building features, fixing bugs, general enhancements), some developers do specialise and focus on specific subject areas. This may happen immediately, or after some time having gained familiarity with many areas of the platform.


Your Responsibilities


In this role, your responsibilities will include;


Work with your colleagues to fix bugs, develop features, and define new services from start to finish.

Responsible for implementing several concurrent, high visibility projects in a fast-paced environment that may cross multiple business unit and/or divisions but focus on show delivery for Technicolor FEV.

Communicate tasks, challenges and workflows across a globally distributed team.

Advocate for professional standards of development.

Troubleshoot problems across different levels of the stack, and in production environments.

Take responsibility for code quality, always leaving projects in better state than before you started work.

Contribute to maintaining an authoritative source of documentation.

Evangelise use of the Core Platform within MPC and other Technicolor business units.

Take initiative to improve the developer experience in small or large ways.

Provide some level of operational support for the platform as required.



About You



Qualifications


To succeed in the role, the following experience and competencies are required;


Production-level experience using Python for web/desktop applications, service backends or development infrastructure.

SQL and general database knowledge for query writing and optimisation.

Solid knowledge of testing principles, in particular TDD and/or BDD.

Proven problem-solving skills around technical, product and business requests.

Be able to consider a technical solution from different perspectives, including algorithms, complexity, correctness, maintainability.

Excellent verbal and written communication skills.

Be self-motivated and demonstrate strong organisational skills.


Previous experience in the VFX industry is not required to be successful in this role.


Nice to Have


The following are not essential to be successful in the role, however prior experience or the desire to grow in these areas will be of benefit;


ReactJS exposure or any similar framework is an added advantage.

Knowledge of the various components used to develop micro-service frameworks (such as uWSGI, NGINX, RabbitMQ and Flask).

Knowledge in k8/Kubernetes and Docker is an added advantage.

Understanding of CI/CD best practices and advocate for their use and improvement.

Tractor knowledge is an added advantage.

Cloud experience.

Cross-platform development on Windows and OS X.

Job Description



About The Team and Our Work


Our status as a world-class VFX facility has been achieved through the development of industry-leading software which empowers our artists to create stunning imagery. We have curated a considerable portfolio of off-the-shelf and in-house software to meet these unique requirements, and continue to evolve and improve our technology as new needs emerge. The Core Engineering team operates within a larger R&amp;D division to provide the business critical infrastructure that enables multiple projects with thousands of shots to be simultaneously completed across the globe efficiently and to the highest quality.

A blend of globally distributed software, systems and operations experts, we are responsible for building and maintaining key infrastructure and services in collaboration with site-local engineering teams and other specialized development teams. With users in all areas of the company, our solution (the Core Platform) is based on a distributed micro-services environment providing capabilities in areas such as compute, storage, sync, and digital asset management. Development and operational support spans the stack from operating system through to desktop/web application front-ends.

In recognition of the flexibility, scalability and maturity of the Core Platform that has been created by the team for MPC, we have been tasked with establishing the Core Platform elsewhere, making it available to other business units that are part of Technicolor’s portfolio.


About The Role


As a Software Developer in the Core Engineering team, your role is to further the development of the Core Platform to meet the needs of our users and the wider business.

You will draw on your skills and experience to both extract and modernise the Core Platform for use by other Technicolor companies, and to maintain ongoing use by MPC. You will focus on developing services and APIs that encapsulate the business logic of the platform, in areas such as compute, storage, digital asset management and digital resource management. You will be building internally facing interfaces to our platform and production data.

The Core Platform has a broad scope and diverse user group. While there is some expectation of the role to work across multiple aspects of the platform (building features, fixing bugs, general enhancements), some developers do specialise and focus on specific subject areas. This may happen immediately, or after some time having gained familiarity with many areas of the platform.


Your Responsibilities


In this role, your responsibilities will include;


Work with your colleagues to develop features, fix bugs, and define new services from start to finish.

Advocate for professional standards of development.

Troubleshoot problems across different levels of the stack, and in production environments.

Take responsibility for code quality, always leaving projects in better state than before you started work.

Contribute to maintaining an authoritative source of documentation.

Evangelise use of the Core Platform within MPC and other Technicolor business units.

Take initiative to improve the developer experience in small or large ways.

Provide some level of operational support for the platform as required.



About You



Qualifications


To succeed in the role, the following experience and competencies are required;


Production-level experience using Python for desktop applications, service backends or development infrastructure.

An understanding of concurrency as it applied to CPython, and writing code that scales gracefully.

Strong knowledge of microservices architecture, design and implementation.

SQL and general database knowledge for query writing and optimisation.

A working understanding of HTTP and JSON.

Familiarity with source control, in particular Git, and associated best practices.

Comfortable working in a primarily Linux based development and runtime environment.

Solid knowledge of testing principles, in particular TDD and/or BDD.

Proven problem-solving skills around technical, product and business requests.

Be able to consider a technical solution from different perspectives, including algorithms, complexity, correctness, maintainability.

Excellent verbal and written communication skills.

Be self-motivated and demonstrate strong organisational skills.


Previous experience in the VFX industry is not required to be successful in this role.


Nice to Have


The following are not essential to be successful in the role, however prior experience or the desire to grow in these areas will be of benefit;


Knowledge of the various components used to develop micro-service frameworks (such as uWSGI, NGINX, RabbitMQ and Flask).

Knowledge in k8/Kubernetes and Docker.

Knowledge of monitoring tools (such as Prometheus, Alert Manager, Grafana and Graylog).

Understanding of CI/CD best practices and advocate for their use and improvement.

Cross-platform development on Windows and OS X.

Knowledge of Python packages and frameworks such as Flask, PyQt, PyMySQL, etc.

Experience of Agile and lean methodologies, and an interest in process improvement in these areas.

Comfortable working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment where requirements change.

You’re the ideal candidate if you are a savvy software engineer with experience in data engineering and a solid background in Spark and Python. Preferably you know that countMinSketch is not a children’s game. You have worked in a Cloud environment and are comfortable wearing several hats in a small organization with a wide range of responsibilities.

Convert prototypes into production data engineering solutions through disciplined software engineering practices, Spark optimizations, and modern deployment pipelines

Collaborate on design, implementation, and deployment of applications with the rest of the software engineering team

Support data scientists and product teams in building, debugging, and deploying Spark applications that best leverage data

Build and maintain tools for automation, deployment, monitoring, and operations

Create test plans, test cases, and run tests with automated tools




What you’ll bring:




6+ years of experience with Python3, and 2+ years experience with Spark. Scala experience is helpful

5+ years of experience in data engineering, data science, and related data-centric fields using large-scale data environments

3+ years of experience in using SQL and working with modern relational databases, including MySQL or PostgreSQL

3+ years of experience with developing ETL pipelines and data manipulation scripts

Proficient in Object-Oriented Design and S.O.L.I.D principles

Strong emphasis on unit testing and code quality

Proficient with AWS products (EMR S3, Lambda, VPC, EC2, API Gateway, etc)

MS or BS in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent work experience required




What success looks like: 




After six months, you will…


Complete onboarding by demonstrating knowledge of the Data Lake and associated technologies and CI/CD processes by deploying ETL pipelines for curation &amp; warehousing to production

Complete rotations on “bug duty” where you will gain experience with the different systems, tools, and processes in the Data Lake by resolving reported issues

Contribute to the team's velocity by participating in Scrum and driving stories to completion

After about a year, you will…


Be an expert on the Data Lake target state architecture and drive engineering design and grooming sessions for new feature development

Apply coding best practices and provide in-depth reviews on the team's pull requests

Be a thought leader in one or more domains of the Data Lake, driving development and mentoring teammates in this domain

Role: OPERATIONS WINDOWS SRE - (220000DU)



Location: Toronto, CA






Who are we?


The SRE Operations team at CX Marketing Eloqua are the core responsible for ensuring our production platform stays online, performant and up to date. As senior technologists, we manage our on-prem hardware infrastructure from SAN storage, to Hypervisor to OS and application, as well as planning and executing on our migration to OCI Cloud Infrastructure. 

Our team is dedicated to the continuous improvement of both systems and processes related to delivering the Eloqua application to our customers.

 


Who are we looking for?


We have a global team spanning 4 different geographical sites in North America and India. We are looking for a highly technical member who will plan and execute critical state-of-the-art infrastructure build and improvement projects for the CX Marketing Eloqua application.

If you are looking for a place where you can bring in your creativity and use the latest tools and frameworks look no further 

 


Job Responsibilities 


Following are the essential responsibilities of this role. It is a constantly evolving role with increased responsibilities as the business evolves


Work on varied projects within the CX Marketing Eloqua SRE team.

Work closely with the team in India and North America (Canada and US).

Work on our Legacy and Cloud infrastructure stack and make continual improvements for increased throughput and optimal use of resources.

Troubleshoot escalated issues related to server build consistency, performance, and best practices for key components.

Mentor junior members of the team and interns in technical aspects.

Plan for and execute regular maintenance including OS patching, image updating and deployment of images in legacy and cloud environments.

Work on migrating Eloqua to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using tools like terraform/terragrunt, helm, etc.


 


Our stack and philosophy


Chef, terraform/terragrunt, Hyper-V, IIS, Kafka, Gitlab, Docker, Teamcity, Sensu, Grafana, Prometheus, ELK stack, WebLogic, PowerShell, Ruby/Javascript, RabbitMQ, Systemd, Active Directory, PowerMTA, Windows/Linux, Data Visualization technologies etc..

Our Product stack is on both Windows and Linux, and we develop on Macs. Expertise in both platforms is essential for success.

Scale is our current passion and our backlog of exciting projects are tremendous

While Ruby is our current favorite for most of the development (specifically Chef), it doesn't matter if you are a star programmer in any of the following - Java, C++/C#, Javascript, Python - we will be happy to talk to you too

We are obviously big on databases - Microsoft as well as Oracle. Comfort in SQL is all we are looking for in these positions. Of course, deep knowledge of Oracle databases is an added plus.

Our philosophy is to make the life of our developers, testers and cloud team and eventually our customers as easy as possible.

This would probably be your once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of a startup kind of culture with the benefits of the backing of one of the most reputed and largest companies around.

 


Skill-sets needed:


While we know that not everyone can be a master at everything, we are looking for people with interest and basic understanding of the following

 


Windows 
– Everyone has done windows sometime or other. You will be doing more. Need to know Windows Services layer, APIs and probably done some sort of batch scripting on Windows servers

 


Active Directory
 – Do you know FSMO roles? Familiar with replication, USNs, Kerberos? We use AD in our server infrastructure for almost everything, so knowing how to make it work well is critical

 


Networking
 – We deal with very many networking challenges in our day-to-day work. While we do not expect you to be a network administrator, understanding of the basic concepts of networking is a must have.

 


Chef/Ansible
– Have you done Chef or Ansible? By that what we mean is you have written scripts using these tools, not just used them. If not, how about
 CFEngine, Saltstack, or Puppet?


 


PowerShell
 – Knowing PowerShell scripting is highly valuable in an environment heavily using Windows Server, SQL Server and Active Directory.

 


Linux
 – Need system level knowledge of Linux. Starting from understanding of Kernel architecture, process management and configuring a linux system?

 


Docker and Containers
 – Being able to build and deploy images is a critical part of our operations. We expect all our stack to be containerized in the next several months. Have you heard about this technology and does it interest you?

 


Shell/Perl/Regex
 – Knowing Shell scripting or Perl would show us that you have solid system administration automation experience. 

 


PowerShell
 – Knowing PowerShell scripting is highly valuable in an environment heavily using Windows Server, SQL Server and Active Directory.

 


Agile/Scrums/Kanban/JIRA
 – The SRE team does agile. We have 2 week sprints while managing the day-to-day ad-hoc operational needs.

 


Git
 – You are more than just a Git user. Would you know how to branch, merge, squash, stash, and patch?

 


CI Systems
 – We are big on 
Teamcity
. If you are not, don’t worry, how about 
Jenkins/Buildbot/Electric Commander/Hudson/Circle
 or any other popular ones? Again, we are looking for someone who has modeled workflows in a CI system and has in depth administration knowledge or at least understanding of the concepts. We leverage these systems along with app deployment teams to execute regular and ad-hoc jobs

 


Databases / SQL
 – Being at Oracle developing enterprise systems, we need you to have a pretty good understanding of databases. We prefer Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database. If your understanding of how these databases work is minimal, we would at least want you to be familiar with SQL syntax from basic (INSERT/SELECT) to intermediate ( JOIN/UNION/SCHEMA/STREAM/etc)

 


Email
 – Email functionality is a core feature of our service. Understanding of SMTP, IMAP as well as best practices using SPF, DKIM, DMARC is beneficial.

 


Communication skills
 – Perhaps this is one of the most important skills that is often overlooked. Our team currently is spread across potentially 6 geographical locations and effective oral and written communication is what’s really going to make it successful. SRE @ Oracle requires people skills in supporting several people around the world and gone are the days when you are a reclusive programmer

Company Description



Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.



Job Description



Retailers have struggled too long with clunky, outdated and disconnected tools. Even as mammoth Retail and e-commerce forces threaten to disrupt smaller merchants, we are empowering those merchants with simple and elegant solutions to complex problems - like predictive analytics and fluid, omni-channel capabilities to meet customers wherever they are - to always make the sale.

Square for Retail is a growing product team based out of New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Atlanta. We benefit from (and contribute to) the resources of the larger organization while staying focused on solving Retail-specific challenges. We are relentlessly customer focused, and iterate quickly using a build-measure-learn approach.



You Will




Build and test iOS software with complex server, network and hardware interactions;

Craft pixel-perfect, intuitive UI that delights our sellers with its ease of use;

Work with a world-class team of experienced and dedicated engineers and designers;

Deliver features to our growing base of subscribers, shipped at a rapid cadence;

Be a part of creating an innovative product that brings superpowers to sellers.




You Have




Qualifications



4+ years of iOS development experience, and an excellent command of engineering fundamentals

An academic attitude towards software development practices

Unwavering commitment to customer experience and product quality

Eagerness to share your own ideas, and openness to those of others

A record of self-directed side projects, research, or open source contributions are a plus!




Technologies We Use And Teach




Swift, Objective-C, iOS SDK

Workflow, Blueprint

Protocol buffers, external hardware connectivity and networking technologies

About Netskope



Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive. Visit us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter@Netskope.

About HashiCorp



At HashiCorp, we’re building a generation-defining infrastructure software company, powered by our core principles and a growing team of talented, committed professionals working together to help organizations seamlessly transition to and operate in the cloud. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in San Francisco, 85 percent of our employees work remotely, strategically distributed around the globe. From our inception we built the company with a remote-first approach because we believe talent has no boundaries.


Our Engineering Organization


At HashiCorp, we build Consul, Nomad, Vault, Terraform, Packer, and Vagrant. Our Tao of HashiCorp contains our guiding principles for product development; a strong set of company principles informs how we interact with each other.

Our focus is on platform reliability, visibility, and scalability. As technical leaders, SREs have deep knowledge of our production systems. They are responsible for incident management, leading teams to resolve issues and bring to light impactful remediation items that help improve reliability. We view Infrastructure Engineering as distinct from an SRE practice, though we do consult, collaborate, and embed with our Infrastructure teams when there are opportunities or needs to improve the reliability or scalability of the infrastructure.

Drive internal and external SLAs that meet and exceed expectations, ensure System centric SLOs are continuously monitored and guide teams to improve

Create tools for monitoring and operations of the overall platform

Participate in an on-call rotation, and assist as incident commander for major incidents

Provide ongoing maintenance and support of incident process and tooling to improve system health and reliability

Write code mostly in Golang, learning from and contributing to a team committed to continually improving their skills

Work with HashiCorp products such as Terraform, Consul, Vault, and Nomad

Reduce toil for engineering teams by writing automation 



You may be a good fit for our team if you have:



Familiarity with infrastructure management via terraform and operations lifecycle concepts and ecosystem

Experience operating and maintaining production systems in a Linux and public cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, GCP

Experience developing software focused on systems and operational automation in a large-scale distributed environment

A desire to build against industry best practices with regard to information security and willingness to partner with security practitioners 

You have built or operated a mission critical cloud service

Comfortable with Go preferably or another low-level programming language

You are interested or experienced in observability practices and how that can enable teams

You have excellent knowledge of at least one of our HashiCorp products



We’d love to hear from you!


HashiCorp is an open source company. We take great joy in helping developers, designers, and infrastructure practitioners build and deploy applications with our products.
