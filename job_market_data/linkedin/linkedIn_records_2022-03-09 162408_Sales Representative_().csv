We are living in a world where machines are becoming smarter every day. They are taking over mundane yet crucial tasks (such as driving) and letting humans focus on living a more creative, fruitful life. Training these machines to perceive the physical environment and make mission-critical decisions is a complex task that heavily relies on using massive amounts of perception data. The large volume, high variety, and lack of structure in the perception data pose a crippling data operation problem for teams that build these smart machines. We want to solve this problem.




We are committed to simplifying machine learning (ML) workflow management for perception-heavy applications such as autonomous vehicles, drones, smart robotics, and surveillance. By focusing on finding the most valuable training data our flagship product, SceneBox, helps perception teams to build better training datasets faster, to focus on core ML tasks rather than data operations, and significantly reduces ML product time to market. 




The ideal candidate is an energetic self-starter with the ability to identify influencers and key decision makers within accounts. You will discover qualified opportunities by responding to inbound interests and targeted outbound prospects to build rapport and establish long-term relationships.

        As a Sales Development Representative at Moveworks, you’ll be the voice that shares our game-changing AI technology with the world’s leading companies. Alongside the Sales Development Manager, you’ll define our outreach strategy — determining the most powerful approaches to identify and create qualified opportunities for our Account Executives. Moveworks is using AI and machine learning to transform how companies support their employees, and this role will challenge you to continually learn how we provide value to our customers.

Those customers speak for themselves: Slack, LinkedIn, DocuSign, HP, Gap, Verizon, and Broadcom, just to name a few. But before they became customers — and before they began saving more than a million dollars each year with Moveworks — they were prospects. It all starts with you, the Sales Development Representative, when you reach out to the right IT leader, at the right company, with the right messaging. You understand that sales is a unique blend of science and art, and you’re ready to apply your experience at an AI startup that’s doubled its revenue and customer base in each of the last three years.


Who we are:


Moveworks is revolutionizing how companies support their employees — with the first AI platform that makes getting help at work effortless. Using advanced conversational AI built for the enterprise, Moveworks gives employees exactly what they need, from IT support to HR help to policy information. Our platform allows customers like DocuSign, Twitter, Snowflake, Instacart, Coca Cola, and Hearst to move forward on what matters.

Founded in 2016, Moveworks has raised $315 million in funding, at a valuation of $2.1 billion. We’ve been named to the Forbes AI 50 list for three consecutive years, while earning recognition as the Best Chatbot Solution at the 2021 AI Breakthrough Awards. Above all, we’ve built an AI company that puts people first, which is why Built In named Moveworks the #1 Best Place to Work in the Bay Area.


What you’ll do:



Generate outbound leads, drive attendance to our webinars and events, and qualify inbound inquiries to build pipeline for our Account Executives

Prospect creatively, with a focus on phone, email, and social media (Linkedin Twitter, etc.) 

Achieve and exceed monthly targets for meetings, lead creation, and pipeline generated

Continually learn the new ways that Moveworks delivers instant support to employees — while saving service desks time and money

Be a key player in weekly team meetings to discuss challenges and celebrate wins 




What you bring to the table:



1-2 years of software sales development experience 

Experience using sales automation tools, such as Outreach or Salesloft 

Experience using Salesforce and LinkedIn Sales Navigator 

A history of meeting or exceeding monthly targets 

A deep passion for sales and the sales process 

A knack for organization and the ability to manage data

A growth mindset and deep curiosity about technology and/or AI

A proven power of persuasion needed to overcome objections

About New Level Brewing





We are a musically inspired brewery with a DIY ethos. Our love of beer is combined with our love of fun and weird subcultures. 




We are committed to providing a safe, respectful and inclusive environment. 

 

We have always strived to brew weird beer for weird people, and to set ourselves apart in the craft beer industry by rejecting elitist culture of elitism and holding space for people who may not feel welcome elsewhere. 





​Core Values


​


1. It's Gotta Be Fun.
 Rather than worry about what is and isn't beer, the big question for NLB is whether or not it would be a good time. If we are having fun making it and selling it, then people will have fun drinking it and that's what matters to us. 

​


2. Dream it. Brew it.
 The amazing thing about beer is that even though it's ancient, we can still come up with new flavor profiles and brewing techniques. At NLB, nothing is necessarily off the table in terms of style or production methods. New Level means No Limits. 

​​


3. Craft is For Everyone.
 We take craft beer seriously and strive for the highest quality possible, but we are adamantly opposed to attempts to turn beer culture into another version of elitist wine culture. We hope that by brewing a wide array of styles that appeal to all sorts of people, that NLB can broaden the range of people who enjoy craft beer.

41,2928620501,Sales Development Representative,Full-time,Entry level,FigBytes Inc.,"Software Development, Environmental Services, and Internet Publishing",Canada,"



Who Is FigBytes &amp; How Are They Changing the World?





FigBytes is first a mission, a call to action - before they are a software company. Founded in 2013, FigBytes was a response from founders Ted and Sonam witnessing devastating breakdowns in our environment: the wildfires in California, cities in India running out of clean drinking water, rising pollution levels, and more.




They noticed enterprise organizations and governments move toward corporate social responsibility - tying their success metrics to the impact they have on the world around them (about time, they thought!)




But there was a missing piece to these admirable goals: Tracking them. How could these organizations quantify their sustainability, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals and measure their progress towards said goals? From these needs, FigBytes was born. Their cloud-based platform allows customers to embed their ESG objectives and metrics into their performance, strategy and brand. They transform data into real-time storytelling, removing data complexity so customers can focus on what truly matters - meeting their ESG goals. 




Since environmental sustainability is both impacting and impacted by just about everyone, FigBytes serves a large and diverse market. Their priority segments include consumer goods, hotels/resorts, financial services, technology, oil &amp; gas, and government entities such as states and municipalities. With clients such as the State of Minnesota, AECOM, City of Phoenix, University of Alberta, McDermott, Ford, TongaatHulett, and more, FigBytes stands on solid ground to arm global entities with the means to achieve mission-critical ESG objectives. 




With a combination of VC and government funding, FigBytes is in the perfect opportunity to have an impact on a fast-growing organization.





How Will I Make An Impact?





Reporting to the VP of Sales, your role is critical in ensuring FigBytes achieves its growth targets. As our first dedicated Sales Development Representative, you will take on all things related to developing net new leads with our enterprise customer market, which includes:





Actively seeking out new customers by cold calling to businesses across North America.

Completing 60+ outbound calls per day or 2+ hours of talk time.

Developing relationships with prospects to identify revenue opportunities and broaden their knowledge of our product offering.

Respond to all/any incoming customer inquiries.

Qualify potential leads and transfer them to Senior Account Executives as needed

Help develop and maintain a database of qualified leads, through referrals, telephone canvassing, cold calling, email, and networking.

Maximize all opportunities in the process of closing a sale.

Execute the daily operational, day-to-day goals and priorities assigned by the manager.

Adhere to company policies, and understand procedures and concepts of deal structure and strategy.

Provide excellent customer service to our clients and maintain high standards.






The ideal candidate will have the following:






A desire to build a career in enterprise software sales

Willingness and the ability to pick up the phone and start conversations with strangers all day

Ambition 

Openness to learning

Empathy

Resilience

Outside the box thinking

Problem-solving

Ability to thrive in a dynamic environment and ever-evolving industry

Customer centricity

Strong verbal and written communication skills

It’s simple: we want 
more leads
! Specifically, free trials or meetings booked for our account executives team, and if the person on the phone is able to be closed right then, then 
we want more sales
 too! 



This is a sales role for someone ambitious looking to dive into tech sales and learn quickly. If this sounds like you, why don't you learn a little more about us:



Paystone is a London Ontario founded company, but we’re hiring everywhere now. So if the location isn’t important to you, it isn’t to us either. Paystone started in the payment processing industry and has since expanded to include gift cards, loyalty, reputation management, and marketing programs and now we need a Sales Development Rep to continue to support the success of potential customers and help us grow.



You’ll need to be eager and ready to work hard. We’re moving fast, and that means doing a lot more in less time. Still, work-life balance is important so you won’t be taking on more than is reasonable to accomplish within normal working hours.




Now, the non-exhaustive list of things we want you to thrive in:





B.eing a super-networker, able to talk to anyone, anywhere, anytime about anything.

Excellent written communication skills and excellent emotional intelligence.

A hustler, a grinder, whatever you want to call it. You work hard to drive results, and are relentlessly looking for opportunity. 

Very competitive, but more so with yourself than with others (we're a team after all!).


As long as you think you have either the necessary skills or the ability to learn them very quickly to do this role, you’re good. We care about your ability to execute, not your experience.
 





 Perks &amp; Benefits






Compensation (fixed and variable) tied to market data (we user Mercer)

We reward for contribution

Everyone gets Equity

Unlimited Vacation - yes, for real

We’re committed to career development

Work from home

We are not a funding organization; we are a funding support services company, guiding businesses towards the right sources of cash, while minimizing their time with the funding application process.

NOTE: This role requires multi-team collaboration in addition to autonomous work.



The Ongoing Expectations For The Role Include



The successful candidate will work directly with Ontario businesses to assess their strategic challenges and growth opportunities. The main role of the Sales Development Analyst (SDA) will be to qualify Canadian business owners for funding opportunities and assign qualified leads to the sales team to identify specific funding opportunities. You will be the first contact for new leads, feeding the sales team’s pipeline and the application writing opportunities for our operations team.


Lead Qualification – 70%


Connecting with leads for one-on-one company profiling; primarily over the phone calls and video conferencing. New Leads will come from:


Online contact forms

Toll free numbers

Website chat

Social media

Referrals from strategic partners and clients

Live events and webinars


The SDA will be utilize analytics software to track their progress and impact towards the business’ top line. As a hybrid marketing-sales support role, the SDA will have the opportunity to influence the marketing strategy and fine-tune the lead qualification process.

The SDA will be assigned Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) based on basic demographic criteria or referrals and will need to qualify them and their strategic spends to identify government funding potential. The SDA will qualify these MQLs into Sales Qualified Leads (SQL) to pass over to the sales team to explore funding program opportunities.


Qualified Lead Assignment – 20%


Transitioning leads to the sales team for more in-depth funding identification. You will be responsible for making the appropriate introductions and communicating known key details with relevant team members. This process will be guided by a Sales Level Agreement (SLA) between the sales development team and the business development team to ensure both teams are working together cohesively.


Process Development &amp; Testing – 10%


Testing processes and lead generation tactics will keep us evolving our approach to cater to leads’ changing needs and interests. This role will also work to identify, experiment, and give feedback on new approaches for lead generation.



Responsibilities




Manage inbound lead channels, including calls from the toll-free line, contact form submissions, and marketing qualified leads (MQLs) interacting in website content.

Qualify and educate leads about the government funding application process.

Utilize multiple communication methods to engage with leads, including email, video calls, and phone calls.

Work with the marketing team to optimize lead qualification and online marketing tactics.

Maintain knowledge of funding types and what kinds of factors make a company meet eligibility for funding.


About you:


The SDA is the gatekeeper of the team. You will be responsible for the smooth transition of qualified leads to the best resources in house that can assist with government funding. Of course, we can’t help everyone, so equally important - you will feel comfortable directing leads to outside resources. You are a scheduling wizard, able to anticipate the needs and capacity of the sales team - knowing what a full schedule looks like for each supported team member and booking with that in mind; it’s a real art form.

For you, a day without phone calls and interaction from clients is just not a good day. You are outgoing and thrive on communicating, understanding the power of a great first impression to new leads. You radiate professionalism and pride yourself on the quality of the customer experience you provide.

You also understand that, without first-class organization skills, a smooth transition to the team is not possible. You’re comfortable juggling pre-assigned tasks alongside impromptu opportunities to build your lead funnel through inbound calls. Writing down your findings in a shared team database and building schedules comes easy to you.

        Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

You are a stellar salesperson seeking a thriving work environment that recognizes and rewards the quality you bring to your work every day. Do you want an assured weekly paycheck that delivers 100% of what your work is worth? Do you value the flexibility to craft your work hours to not exceed 40 hours per week and without being at the 24x7 beck and call of your customers? If so, you’ll love our Inside Sales team.

Traditional sales processes are broken. Strong salespeople get pushed into a single product and are often judged solely against numbers they did not set, as opposed to the quality of work they deliver. The constant need to give so much to your role to achieve even base compensation, let alone meeting arbitrary and unrealistic goals to earn additional income, will often end up burning out the best salespeople. At Trilogy, we created a super-effective sales process that cuts through all that and services customers who already use and love at least one of our 100+ products.

Forget about hidden goals that limit your compensation under the guise of a bonus. We don’t assess you based on how many calls you close, and we don’t penalize you if a customer chooses to walk away. We reward you based on how well you deliver defined expectations during sales calls.

If you have an eye for detail and can leverage our standardized processes to enhance your sales abilities, you will succeed here.



What You Will Be Doing




Making high-quality renewal calls that ensure customers understand how our products solve their problems and are receiving all the benefits that each product provides

Acting as strategic advisor through the renewals process to assist customers maximize the return on their investment in our software products




What You Won’t Be Doing




Wasting time on meaningless activities that come with many sales jobs: negotiating prices, project management, or time tracking.

Chasing commissions or drawing up invoices to get your earned compensation. We make assured weekly payments that enable you to do what you do best: sell.

Lead generation and writing your own sales content. We have tried-and-true processes that give you space to do your sales work.




Senior Inside Sales Representative Key Responsibilities




Ensure that our products to continue to be the best fit for our customers’ needs

Provide valuable insights and recommendations that contribute to our customers’ success




Basic Requirements




At least 5 years of total sales experience

At least 2 years software sales experience

Excellent verbal and written communication skills

        Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

You are a stellar salesperson seeking a thriving work environment that recognizes and rewards the quality you bring to your work every day. Do you want an assured weekly paycheck that delivers 100% of what your work is worth? Do you value the flexibility to craft your work hours to not exceed 40 hours per week and without being at the 24x7 beck and call of your customers? If so, you’ll love our Inside Sales team.

Traditional sales processes are broken. Strong salespeople get pushed into a single product and are often judged solely against numbers they did not set, as opposed to the quality of work they deliver. The constant need to give so much to your role to achieve even base compensation, let alone meeting arbitrary and unrealistic goals to earn additional income, will often end up burning out the best salespeople.

        Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

You are a stellar salesperson seeking a thriving work environment that recognizes and rewards the quality you bring to your work every day. Do you want an assured weekly paycheck that delivers 100% of what your work is worth? Do you value the flexibility to craft your work hours to not exceed 40 hours per week and without being at the 24x7 beck and call of your customers? If so, you’ll love our Inside Sales team.

Traditional sales processes are broken. Strong salespeople get pushed into a single product and are often judged solely against numbers they did not set, as opposed to the quality of work they deliver. The constant need to give so much to your role to achieve even base compensation, let alone meeting arbitrary and unrealistic goals to earn additional income, will often end up burning out the best salespeople. At Trilogy, we created a super-effective sales process that cuts through all that and services customers who already use and love at least one of our 100+ products.

Forget about hidden goals that limit your compensation under the guise of a bonus. We don’t assess you based on how many calls you close, and we don’t penalize you if a customer chooses to walk away. We reward you based on how well you deliver defined expectations during sales calls.

If you have an eye for detail and can leverage our standardized processes to enhance your sales abilities, you will succeed here.



What You Will Be Doing




Making high-quality renewal calls that ensure customers understand how our products solve their problems and are receiving all the benefits that each product provides

Acting as strategic advisor through the renewals process to assist customers maximize the return on their investment in our software products




What You Won’t Be Doing




Wasting time on meaningless activities that come with many sales jobs: negotiating prices, project management, or time tracking.

Chasing commissions or drawing up invoices to get your earned compensation. We make assured weekly payments that enable you to do what you do best: sell.

Lead generation and writing your own sales content. We have tried-and-true processes that give you space to do your sales work.




Inside Sales Representative Key Responsibilities




Ensure that our products to continue to be the best fit for our customers’ needs

Provide valuable insights and recommendations that contribute to our customers’ success




Basic Requirements




At least 5 years of total sales experience

At least 2 years software sales experience

        Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

You are a stellar salesperson seeking a thriving work environment that recognizes and rewards the quality you bring to your work every day. Do you want an assured weekly paycheck that delivers 100% of what your work is worth? Do you value the flexibility to craft your work hours to not exceed 40 hours per week and without being at the 24x7 beck and call of your customers? If so, you’ll love our Inside Sales team.

Traditional sales processes are broken. Strong salespeople get pushed into a single product and are often judged solely against numbers they did not set, as opposed to the quality of work they deliver. The constant need to give so much to your role to achieve even base compensation, let alone meeting arbitrary and unrealistic goals to earn additional income, will often end up burning out the best salespeople. At Trilogy, we created a super-effective sales process that cuts through all that and services customers who already use and love at least one of our 100+ products.

Forget about hidden goals that limit your compensation under the guise of a bonus. We don’t assess you based on how many calls you close, and we don’t penalize you if a customer chooses to walk away. We reward you based on how well you deliver defined expectations during sales calls.

If you have an eye for detail and can leverage our standardized processes to enhance your sales abilities, you will succeed here.

        Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

You are a stellar salesperson seeking a thriving work environment that recognizes and rewards the quality you bring to your work every day. Do you want an assured weekly paycheck that delivers 100% of what your work is worth? Do you value the flexibility to craft your work hours to not exceed 40 hours per week and without being at the 24x7 beck and call of your customers? If so, you’ll love our Inside Sales team.

Traditional sales processes are broken. Strong salespeople get pushed into a single product and are often judged solely against numbers they did not set, as opposed to the quality of work they deliver. The constant need to give so much to your role to achieve even base compensation, let alone meeting arbitrary and unrealistic goals to earn additional income, will often end up burning out the best salespeople.

Pourquoi vous aimerez Softchoice:



Une société du secteur des TI qui donne aux entreprises les moyens d’être agiles et novatrices, et à leur personnel, les moyens d’être productif, créatif et plus heureux au travail. Des moyens qui facilitent leur passage à l’infonuagique, les aident à construire le lieu de travail de demain et leur permettent de prendre des décisions plus judicieuses quant à leur portefeuille technologique. Le succès est ainsi atteint plus rapidement et dans des circonstances qui, autrement, ne le permettraient pas.

Softchoice est fière de ses employées et employés. Elle les soutient dans leur quête de succès en leur offrant des possibilités de perfectionnement et d’avancement professionnels. Reconnu(e)s et respecté(e)s pour notre culture d’inclusion et d’appartenance, nous n’avons de cesse de veiller à l’intérêt de nos employé(e)s et de nos collectivités.



Faites votre marque :   



Guider nos clients vers un avenir multinuage!   

L’infonuagique publique offre une multitude de possibilités et d’avantages aux entreprises de toutes tailles. Mais elle crée aussi de nouveaux défis, de nouvelles craintes et des obstacles à l’adoption de technologies. Voilà où votre rôle prend tout son sens.  

En tant que représentante ou représentant en ventes spécialisées pour l’infonuagique, votre mission est de mettre les entreprises sur la meilleure voie possible vers un avenir durable et novateur avec un environnement multinuage. Ce faisant, vous créerez de nouvelles occasions de vente et surmonterez des barrières technologiques et commerciales, tout en proposant une feuille de route convaincante et personnalisée vers la transformation numérique.  

Bien qu’il s’agisse de l’un des plus récents rôles à Softchoice, il a été conçu à la lumière de notre promesse faite de longue date de bien faire les choses pour nos clients. En cette ère de perturbation, de rapidité et de complexité, nos représentants en infonuagique publique ne se contentent pas de vanter les vertus du nuage. Ils aident aussi les clients à en comprendre les limites en contribuant à réduire, ou optimiser, l’utilisation des centres de données et réseaux existants. Vous travaillerez en étroite collaboration avec le directeur du Service des ventes de produits spécialisés, votre équipe de ventes régionales et les services professionnels et de gestion impartie pour développer et mettre en œuvre des solutions d’infonuagique publique et multinuage, qui à leur tour aideront les clients à réussir et à prospérer.   



Vos responsabilités :   





Vendre des solutions et des services d’infonuagique publique et multinuage qui comprennent un amalgame de nuages publics, services professionnels et services de gestion impartie.

Upon becoming a vital team member, you will start in a 2-3 week training class to receive a comprehensive education on our:



Nationally recognized customer service and outreach tactics

Detailed overview of products, services, and promotions available

Complete instruction regarding our compliance regulations




What are your day-to-day responsibilities as a Customer Service Representative?



Deliver an exceptional customer experience - ask questions to understand the customer's lifestyle and personal needs, encourage open communication and honesty, and provide product recommendations specifically curated to address their needs 

Meet with customers daily and enter each interaction with the highest degree of courtesy, professionalism, and kindness 

Track and process new orders, account upgrades, and de-escalate customer complaints to increase customer satisfaction

Maintain a broad working knowledge of all products, services, and promotions available to our customers and stay current on industry-related news

You must be able to confidently manage all types of customers and scenarios with understanding and the same level of service every time. 

Adaptability. The best part about working in a people-centric career is no day is ever the same. However, that means you need to be able to roll with the punches, walk into challenges with open arms, and handle surprises with a sense of humor. 

Clear communication. You say what you mean and mean what you say. It is essential that customers fully understand the products and services described to them, promotions available, and their account information. Use authentically positive language, stay engaged, and never walk away without confirming the customer is satisfied with their experience. 

Work ethic. You cannot teach this, and there is a difference between being an efficient worker and a hard worker. An efficient worker is prepared every day and manages their schedule perfectly, so they can effectively help as many customers as possible. 

Knowledge. Ultimately, your responsibility as a Customer Service Representative is to understand a customer's situation, provide product recommendations, answer questions, and be their go-to support throughout the order process. You stay informed enough to respond to their inquiries adequately, and you are humble enough to say, ""I'm not sure."" Customers will appreciate your honesty, and in a reliable team-oriented environment like ours, everyone on the team is excited to help. 

Thick skin. We may be an entrepreneurial-minded firm, but that doesn't change the fact we still believe the customer is always right. The ability to swallow one's pride, accept negative feedback, and work to get better is essential for customer satisfaction and the growth of our organization.

        We are looking for tenacious, self-motivated individuals that are well-versed in a customer-oriented environment and have a flawless reputation for putting the customer first. The mission of our Customer Service Representative is to educate and navigate customers through service and product options available to them in their neighborhood. We emphasize continuous learning and personal development, so there is always someone in your corner to support, help, and hold you accountable to your standards and goals.


Upon becoming a vital team member, you will start in a 2-3 week training class to receive a comprehensive education on our:



Nationally recognized customer service and outreach tactics

Detailed overview of products, services, and promotions available

Complete instruction regarding our compliance regulations




What are your day-to-day responsibilities as a Customer Service Representative?



Deliver an exceptional customer experience - ask questions to understand the customer's lifestyle and personal needs, encourage open communication and honesty, and provide product recommendations specifically curated to address their needs 

Meet with customers daily and enter each interaction with the highest degree of courtesy, professionalism, and kindness 

Track and process new orders, account upgrades, and de-escalate customer complaints to increase customer satisfaction

Maintain a broad working knowledge of all products, services, and promotions available to our customers and stay current on industry-related news

What skills are we looking for in a Customer Service Representative? 



Empathy, patience, and consistency. When you are a Customer Service Representative, you are fully aware that you will help and work with multiple personalities. Some customers may be irate, while others ask an endless amount of questions. You must be able to confidently manage all types of customers and scenarios with understanding and the same level of service every time. 

Adaptability. The best part about working in a people-centric career is no day is ever the same. However, that means you need to be able to roll with the punches, walk into challenges with open arms, and handle surprises with a sense of humor. 

Clear communication. You say what you mean and mean what you say. It is essential that customers fully understand the products and services described to them, promotions available, and their account information. Use authentically positive language, stay engaged, and never walk away without confirming the customer is satisfied with their experience. 

Work ethic. You cannot teach this, and there is a difference between being an efficient worker and a hard worker. An efficient worker is prepared every day and manages their schedule perfectly, so they can effectively help as many customers as possible. 

Knowledge. Ultimately, your responsibility as a Customer Service Representative is to understand a customer's situation, provide product recommendations, answer questions, and be their go-to support throughout the order process. You stay informed enough to respond to their inquiries adequately, and you are humble enough to say, ""I'm not sure."" Customers will appreciate your honesty, and in a reliable team-oriented environment like ours, everyone on the team is excited to help. 

Thick skin. We may be an entrepreneurial-minded firm, but that doesn't change the fact we still believe the customer is always right. The ability to swallow one's pride, accept negative feedback, and work to get better is essential for customer satisfaction and the growth of our organization.
