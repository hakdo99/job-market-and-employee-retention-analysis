Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


The AWS Networking organization is hiring, and we’re looking for talented Network Development Engineers (NDE) to join our team. Within Networking, we’re confronting and solving complex and high-stake challenges. Our teams support all aspects of connectivity to/from Amazon and the outside world, as well as the connectivity between Amazon’s data centers and services. As a member of one our network engineering teams, you will play a part in designing and architecting networks that simply cannot fail, must scale infinitely, and can never constrain growth or innovation.

This opportunity sits within our Internet Services organization where the team is responsible for designing the networks connecting Amazon directly to the outside world (including the Internet, peers, and external customers), evolving the global backbone that interconnects our Regions as well as partnering with our internal customers. Engineers in this organization define routing policy, design and implement Traffic Engineering solutions, as well as architect the hardware platforms and network design to support internal and external connectivity. We move terabits of traffic in and out of our networks each day and are responsible for the ingress and egress points of traffic entering and leaving Amazon as well as the entirety of all internal and customer traffic that rides our global backbone. Engineers on this team make day-to-day and strategic decisions that carry a huge amount of responsibility and impact.



Responsibilities



As a Network Development Engineer at Amazon, your core job responsibility is to design network topologies, architectures, and services that solve for many requirements. We listen to our customers (both internal and external), but we also listen to our teams. Our Engineers contribute materially to each team’s roadmap, and constantly help us to determine what’s most important. Together, you and your leadership team will decide on the projects that best support your team’s mission. You will have the resources and time necessary to understand, scope, and deliver these solutions. The primary area of responsibility you and your team will have is to design ahead of customer or technology needs, always predicting and solving for problems that have not yet occurred. This takes the form of creating and defending High Level Design (HLD) documents, working with vendors or internal stakeholders to influence technology roadmaps, constructing and testing your solutions, and providing support to the teams that will deploy and operate these designs. Our teams also serve as technical escalation points in support of our very talented operations teams.

We’re interested in engineers with experience having designed, operated, and implemented networks of very large scale, and those well versed in the operation of the Internet routing hierarchy. Candidates should understand the theory behind and have deep operational knowledge of routing protocols with particular emphasis on their impact to hardware platforms. We’re looking for those who have pushed platforms to their limits, understand how to work within the limitations imposed by third-party software and how to avoid them through your designs.

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


The AWS Networking organization is hiring, and we’re looking for talented Network Development Engineers (NDE) to join our team. Within Networking, we’re confronting and solving complex and high-stake challenges. Our teams support all aspects of connectivity to/from Amazon and the outside world, as well as the connectivity between Amazon’s data centers and services. As a member of one our network engineering teams, you will play a part in designing and architecting networks that simply cannot fail, must scale infinitely, and can never constrain growth or innovation.

This opportunity sits within our Internet Services organization where the team is responsible for designing the networks connecting Amazon directly to the outside world (including the Internet, peers, and external customers), evolving the global backbone that interconnects our Regions as well as partnering with our internal customers. Engineers in this organization define routing policy, design and implement Traffic Engineering solutions, as well as architect the hardware platforms and network design to support internal and external connectivity. We move terabits of traffic in and out of our networks each day and are responsible for the ingress and egress points of traffic entering and leaving Amazon as well as the entirety of all internal and customer traffic that rides our global backbone.

Together, you and your leadership team will decide on the projects that best support your team’s mission. You will have the resources and time necessary to understand, scope, and deliver these solutions. The primary area of responsibility you and your team will have is to design ahead of customer or technology needs, always predicting and solving for problems that have not yet occurred. This takes the form of creating and defending High Level Design (HLD) documents, working with vendors or internal stakeholders to influence technology roadmaps, constructing and testing your solutions, and providing support to the teams that will deploy and operate these designs. Our teams also serve as technical escalation points in support of our very talented operations teams.

Key job responsibilities

An Internet Edge NDE at AWS is responsible for providing our customers world class Internet connectivity by optimizing for security, availability, performance, and cost. We do this by setting network standards and creating scalable designs that our customers love.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

On-Call Responsibility: S3 services are highly available, but sometimes we occasionally stray away from our normal operations. To minimize the impact of such excursions, we have on-call rotations. However, we set these up so there are focused time periods when you are on-call and when you are not, so you can focus on your day job when not on-call.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth: We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level, etc. You can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. Besides formal mentors, we work and train together, so we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Inclusive Team Culture: We have a diverse team and drive towards an inclusive culture and work environment. Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Our team members are active in Amazon’s 10+ affinity groups, sometimes known as employee resource groups, which bring employees together across businesses and locations around the world. These range from groups such as the Black Employee Network, Amazon Women and Engineering, and LGBTQ+

Job Description



Title: Software Engineer (Platform)



Reports to: Senior Director of Engineering



Location: Anywhere in the USA, Canada, or Latin America






Job Summary


As a Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.





Role Context


Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). Earlier this year we acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on their technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.





Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity



Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.

Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC's directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.

Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product &amp; tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.






Essential Job Functions



Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.

Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.

Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.

Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.






Job Requirements



2-5 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, this is a proxy but not a hard requirement)

Back-end experience with Javascript, Python, or Ruby on Rails and front-end experience with React preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the tech stack with time and direction.

Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.

Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.

Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required

Job Description



Title: 
Software Engineer – Portal


Reports to: 
Director, Digital Platforms


Location:
 Anywhere in the US, Canada, or Latin America





Job Summary


As a Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.





Role Context


Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). Earlier this year we acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech companies like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on their technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.





Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity



Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.

Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.

Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product &amp; tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.






Essential Job Functions



Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.

Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.

Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.

Review &amp; Architect: As a Senior Software Engineer you will play a leadership role in code reviews for the team, helping set the engineer bar, defining best practices, and weighing in on major architecture decisions.

Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.






Job Requirements



5-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, this is a proxy but not a hard requirement)

Back-end experience with PHP, Python (Django), MySQL/PostgreSQL and front-end experience with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.

Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.

Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions

Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.

Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required

Company Description



Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description



Title: Senior Software Engineer



Reports to: Senior Director of Engineering



Location: Anywhere in USA, Canada, or Latin America






Job Summary


As a Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.





Role Context


Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). Earlier this year we acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on their technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.





Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity



Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.

Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC's directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.

Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product &amp; tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.






Job Requirements



5-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, this is a proxy but not a hard requirement)

Back-end experience with Javascript, Python (Django), or Ruby on Rails and front-end experience with React preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.

Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.

Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions

Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.

Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required






Company Information


Franklin Covey Co. (NYSE: FC) is a global, public company, specializing in organizational performance improvement. We help organizations achieve results that require lasting changes in human behavior. Our world-class solutions enable greatness in individuals, teams and organizations and are accessible through the FranklinCovey All Access Pass® available in multiple modalities and in 21 languages.

Company Description



Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.



Job Description



Retailers have struggled too long with clunky, outdated and disconnected tools. Even as mammoth Retail and e-commerce forces threaten to disrupt smaller merchants, we are empowering those merchants with simple and elegant solutions to complex problems - like predictive analytics and fluid, omni-channel capabilities to meet customers wherever they are - to always make the sale.

Square for Retail is a growing product team based out of New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Atlanta. We benefit from (and contribute to) the resources of the larger organization while staying focused on solving Retail-specific challenges. We are relentlessly customer focused, and iterate quickly using a build-measure-learn approach.

We are looking for a talented engineer and passionate team-player to join the Ownr team as a 
Senior Software Engineer
. You'll join a scaling team, designing the next evolution of our platform as we move to provide extensive new capabilities to business owners, and work alongside a close-knit group of ambitious engineers, product managers, and designers.

Your experience will contribute to the functionality, reliability, and delivery of our constantly-evolving Node/React-based applications, leveraging the latest JavaScript-based tooling and best practices. You will also have an opportunity to learn and expand our infrastructure and DevOps pipelines. As part of a young and growing team, you will have daily opportunities to lead and mentor other developers, exercising your skills as a well-rounded cross-functional contributor and technical leader, uniquely in both startup and enterprise environments.





What will you do?



Work with a team of skilled JavaScript developers creating a rapidly evolving consumer-facing platform.

Lead the design and delivery of a significant portion of the software that supports the business, and for monitoring and maintaining that software in production.

Collaborate and organize cross functional partners to turn ambiguity into a practical technical reality.

Work with modern tooling throughout, whether that's something currently part of our stack, or something new that you assess needs to be added to reliably deliver the desired user experience.

Create intuitive, robust and reusable applications using modern frameworks.

Be responsible for finding opportunities to iteratively improve our technology, paying down technical debt as a habit.






About you



You embrace an owner's mindset: continually striving to make an impact; investing time, energy, and capital as if they were your own; and understanding that no part of the business is outside the scope of your position.

You have significant production JavaScript experience, and have formed clear opinions about how different development patterns and practices can both negatively and positively impact your ability to be productive in a codebase, and by extension, the reliability of a business' software platform.

You’re a creative problem solver that can develop a plan, take ownership of tasks, and are outcome focused.

You’re passionate about mentoring and coaching other engineers, and have a practiced ability to spot when help is needed and tactfully provide guidance to get things unstuck.

You behave proactively when confronted with unforeseen challenges and complexity in your projects. Your team members can clearly understand the state of your work, your delivery plans, and your ideas for improving the business’ software, technology processes, and team culture.






What do you need to succeed?



Must have



4+ years of solid hands-on programming experience, with a sizable portion in JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, React, and Postgres.

Experience organizing development teams, mentoring junior developers, and working with non-technical stakeholders.

Experience writing automated tests, from unit tests to end to end tests, and have some knowledge of JavaScript-based testing frameworks.

Experience with source control (e.g. Git + Github) and modern software delivery techniques and tools, including pull requests.

Experience with DevOps best practices and some knowledge in setting up and configuring cloud computing infrastructure.

Experience building production systems, with an understanding of the deployment, monitoring, and security best practices required to run production software.






Nice to have



Post-secondary degree or diploma in a computer or design related program.

About Netskope



Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

 We’ve done our job correctly when none of our users think about us, much like a vital utility. We don’t typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are exceptionally performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, we make Slack work seamlessly. Slack's backend services are written in Go and Java, and Slack's API is built on 
 PHP/Hack
 . Our 
 data infrastructure

 Design, build, ship and maintain the Edge caching services that serves ~20% of all of Slack's API traffic and is critical to Slack’s core functionality. 

 Collaborate with peers in Engineering to triage bugs and fix sophisticated production issues across the stack related to our services. 

 Whiteboard a fix to a scaling or reliability problem, then make it happen. 

 Write, review, or provide feedback on a technical design proposal from other infrastructure teams. 




You may be a fit for this role if you:





 Have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience. 

 Have built large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on. 

 Have built reliable, safe distributed systems and understand the engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either. 

 Work on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture. 

 Love to model modern methodologies for unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built 

 Are curious, inquisitive, and determined to fix things when they break. 




Bonus points





 Experience with AWS 

 Experience building and releasing software using Docker containers 

 Experience with Kubernetes 



 Edge Services is a diverse and inclusive team that is quickly growing and building the future of Slack’s infrastructure. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each other’s growth and it’s not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas from the beginning.

About HashiCorp



At HashiCorp, we’re building a generation-defining infrastructure software company, powered by our core principles and a growing team of talented, committed professionals working together to help organizations seamlessly transition to and operate in the cloud. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in San Francisco, 85 percent of our employees work remotely, strategically distributed around the globe. From our inception we built the company with a remote-first approach because we believe talent has no boundaries.

The Terraform Platform Engineering group is composed of Site Reliability Engineers and distributed systems engineers working on the Terraform Cloud hosted service. Our group ensures that the platform’s underlying infrastructure, data stores, and core foundational services are reliable, performant, and robust. We work closely with the engineering teams that ship features for both Terraform Cloud and the Terraform Enterprise on-premise product. Together, we comprise the Terraform Commercial organization within engineering.

We’re looking to create a new team focused on enabling Terraform Commercial’s 50+ engineers to be more efficient and productive in their work. This team will be focused on three areas: 
DevTools and test environments
, 
build and release pipelines
 (CI/CD, release engineering, etc.), and 
test harnesses and infrastructure
.



This Is a Unique Opportunity For An Experienced Engineer To Help Define The Vision For a New Team That Will Have Tremendous Impact Within Our Group, Seeking Answers To Questions Like




How can we prevent developers from being distracted by flaky tests or a lack of standardized test methodology across our services?

How can we minimize time spent between code commit and production deploy, without sacrificing quality or reliability?

How do we accurately verify changes in our test and staging environments, so we can be confident that a production deploy will be successful?


If this sounds like an interesting opportunity, we’d love to meet you! We have a large footprint and a quickly-growing user base, with lots of interesting problems and plenty of opportunities for growth and development.



Responsibilities




In this role, you can expect to:



Think critically about the current challenges of a high-delivery engineering organization, and develop novel solutions

Jointly develop and execute on a roadmap for solving identified challenges 

Work closely with engineering leaders and managers within our group, and other teams within the company focused on quality and reliability

Grow into a technical leader for a new discipline for our organization




Requirements




You’re a great fit if you have:



Informed opinions (from prior experience) about:


Test methodology and tooling for Go and Rails (RSpec, etc.)

CI / CD tools and build + release pipelines

Test infrastructure and systems supporting complex distributed systems, with several services and codebases 


Experience as a software engineer implementing, testing, and debugging unit tests for Rails and Go applications

Desire to think strategically about these sort of challenges, and jointly develop a vision, roadmap, etc. for a team to execute

Ability to alternate between big-picture thinking and roll-up-your-sleeves engineering work

A passion for focusing work on unblocking others and empowering engineers to do their best work

Comfort working across several Go and Rails codebases


How We Work

At HashiCorp, we operate according to a strong set of company principles, many of which are described in The Tao of HashiCorp. We value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers.

Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team, and this role is no exception. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy.

        Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

Are you the best software architect in your company? Can you identify patterns in complex systems and see ways to make them 10x simpler? Do you enjoy designing software that maximizes the use of existing code? Do you wish you could expand your technical career without requiring more time on HR or project management? If so, you’ll love our approach of driving the direction of products starting with the core technology.

In this role, you will join a passionate and experienced team responsible for all of the important technical decisions on every product in our extensive portfolio of enterprise software solutions. You’ll spend your time making strategic technical design decisions, such as:


What are the core data structures used by the app? Why were they chosen? How are they mapped or applied to the domain of the problem? What were the tradeoffs or alternatives?

What is the rationale behind critical technical dependencies or limitations this product has? Are there new and creative ways to overcome them?

Can the product be broken down logically into smaller, more manageable components?




What You Will Be Doing




Each week you will have a different design problem to work on and a technical spec to create products with distinct tech stacks and business domains.

You will uncover the “high-order bit” decisions by interviewing other technical leads, analyzing the data structures and code/design documents.

You will make important design decisions that specify how to rearchitect products in a cloud-first way on systems such as AWS and GCP.




What You Won’t Be Doing




You will not be making any decisions based primarily on saving money. This is a strategic technical design position that provides clear leadership for our engineering organization to execute on.

You will not participate in daily scrum meetings, making low-level decisions, performing code reviews, or debugging.

You will not be talking to customers or developing a backlog of wishlist features.




Basic Requirements




Principal Software Engineer key responsibilities



At least 2 years of experience writing production-quality code

At least 4 years of experience making important architecture and design decisions on software projects, such as the application of architecture design patterns or significant open source technologies

At least 2 years of experience as the decision-maker for design decisions involving the use of cloud computing services

Experience working as a senior technical leader whose technical design decisions measurably influenced a software development organization of at least 10 people

Ability to simplify complex ideas and communicate them with clear, logical thinking




Nice-to-have Requirements




A university degree that includes the study of data structures and algorithms, or equivalent experience

Description



Are you ready to pursue some of the hardest scalability, performance, and distributed computing challenges in AWS? Our team's vision is to be the world's authoritative provider of AWS computing insight, where customers can understand, control and optimize usage of AWS products. Because we sit at the nexus of all AWS services and interact directly with end-customers, we build relationships with teams across AWS to ensure that we offer a secure and reliable customer experience. We take inputs from these services and merge them with the millions of events every second to produce actionable insight to our customers.

Providing a scalable platform to support AWS’ expanding business is a complex architectural challenge, and accurate cost and usage information is a critical piece. Enterprise-level customers make large dollar-value decisions based on the timeliness, accuracy, and detail of the data provided by our products.

You will take on architectural challenges in making billions of usage records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems. The AWS Insights is changing fast and this is a dynamic role where you will both learn and grow while you contribute to our success.

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.



Position Responsibilities




 Collaborate in the design, implementation, and deployment of successful internet-scale systems and services in support of our commerce operations and the businesses they support.

 Help define our secure, scalable, distributed and event-driven systems.

 Work with extraordinary teams delivering demanding projects.

 Functionally decompose complex problems into simple, straight-forward solutions.

 Understand system interdependencies and limitations.

 Share your knowledge of the most effective performance, scalability, architecture, and engineering patterns and methods.





Basic Qualifications




 Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related field with 3+ year relevant experience.

 Shown skill with Java, C++, or equivalent object-oriented programming languages.

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is storage for the Internet. Through the use of pioneering techniques in storage &amp; computing, customers can reliably store their data on Amazon’s proven computing infrastructure to achieve virtually limitless storage capacity at minimal cost. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that enables customers to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere in the world. It provides all customers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to the customers.

As a Software Engineer working on S3 Multi-Region Access Points, you will design and develop globally distributed highly available services that provide robust, safe and scalable ways for customers to build multi-region applications with the same simple architecture used in a single region. You will develop these services using Kotlin, AWS CDK, DynamoDB, Lambda and StepFunctions, on the AWS Cloud Platform. You will encounter challenges in the domains of performance optimization, availability and reliability, software defined networking, authentication and authorization and DNS. You will operate in a fast paced environment, and follow agile methodologies with a high level of ownership. Expect to ship software today that impacts millions of customers tomorrow.

We are looking for Engineers who can solve complex problems at large scale. Can you think big and simplify complex, sometimes never before seen, problems? Can you own a challenge and work with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to deliver results all the while maintaining standards for your customers? If this describes you then please apply today!

Work-life Balance: Our team works together to provide work/life balance for all team members. We recognize that the circumstances of our team members vary, and we balance work across the team so we’re all able to maintain standards on behalf of our customers, while at the same time allowing for rich and happy personal lives.

On-Call Responsibility: S3 services are highly available, but there are times when we occasionally stray away from our normal operations. To minimize the impact of such excursions, we have on-call rotations. However, we set these up so there are focused time periods when you are on-call and when you are not, so you can focus on your day job when not on-call.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth: We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level, etc. We can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Inclusive Team Culture: We have a diverse team and drive towards an inclusive culture and work environment. Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Our team members are active in Amazon’s 10+ affinity groups, sometimes known as employee resource groups, which bring employees together across businesses and locations around the world. These range from groups such as the Black Employee Network, Amazon Women and Engineering, and LGBTQ+.

DESCRIPTION


Do you want to create the experiences that empower customers to build serverless applications easily and quickly?

We are the Serverless Application Experience team. We own the developer experience that helps customers who want to build, operate, and govern serverless applications that span across multiple AWS services. We ensure customers have a great multi-service experience.

Customers are excited by the vision of serverless: the ability to quickly deliver applications by writing new business logic without needing to become experts in computing and cloud operations. Compared to traditional architectures, customers increasingly build applications using a collection of services, delivering new applications by writing small amounts of business logic connected to other services. This new approach can be a challenge. Serverless applications are made up of many more parts than traditional applications, and those components and services need to be modeled and managed with tools, CI/CD pipelines, and workflows. We believe this challenge of helping customers “cross the chasm” into serverless is another opportunity to delight our customers and make them even more successful. We own the end-to-end experience, working across multiple services, for customers who want to build, operate, and govern serverless applications. We work closely with the service experience teams to deliver simple, powerful, and reliable tools to help customers get to production as quickly as possible. In other words, while each service (Lambda, API Gateway, EventBridge, SQS, etc.) will maintain their developer experience, this team will ensure customers have a great multi-service experience.

We seek engineers to build the next generation of tooling for our Serverless Application Experience. This includes a web experience, CLIs, SDKs, and frameworks.

Description



Are you ready to pursue some of the hardest scalability, performance, and distributed computing challenges in AWS? Our team's vision is to be the world's authoritative provider of AWS computing insight, where customers can understand, control and optimize usage of AWS products. Because we sit at the nexus of all AWS services and interact directly with end-customers, we build relationships with teams across AWS to ensure that we offer a secure and reliable customer experience. We take inputs from these services and merge them with the millions of events every second to produce actionable insight to our customers.

Providing a scalable platform to support AWS’ expanding business is a complex architectural challenge, and accurate cost and usage information is a critical piece. Enterprise-level customers make large dollar-value decisions based on the timeliness, accuracy, and detail of the data provided by our products.

You will take on architectural challenges in making billions of usage records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems. The AWS Insights is changing fast and this is a dynamic role where you will both learn and grow while you contribute to our success.

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.



Position Responsibilities




 Collaborate in the design, implementation, and deployment of successful internet-scale systems and services in support of our commerce operations and the businesses they support.

 Help define our secure, scalable, distributed and event-driven systems.

 Work with extraordinary teams delivering demanding projects.

 Functionally decompose complex problems into simple, straight-forward solutions.

 Understand system interdependencies and limitations.

 Share your knowledge of the most effective performance, scalability, architecture, and engineering patterns and methods.

We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in the way we collaborate.




Over the past 2-years, fuelled by the necessity of the pandemic, we’ve witnessed offices become accepting of remote work and far flung friends become closer. But over the next decade, fuelled by rapidly developing blockchain infrastructure, we see even greater progress towards diversity and inclusivity : where geographic and stakeholder borders are eviscerated.




Founded in December 2021, we’ve already raised financing from leading blockchain investors, operators, and thinkers, and we’ve established an initial team of 5. We’re on a mission to accelerate this vision for an inclusive future by accelerating the next 1B DAO Participants.




We’re now hunting for a senior full stack software engineer. In this exciting role you’ll own the build of one of our products from conception through scale, work at the forefront of one of the fastest growing and most dynamic technical environments of all-time, and team up with a daring, performing, caring, curious and integrative group of seasoned builders and operators.





You will




Own our Discovery product
. You’ll be building the primary hub that fellow degens will use for discovering, learning, and joining DAOs.


Build across the stack
. You’ll implement and make decisions about the frameworks, protocols, and architecture for that product. You’ll work across the front and back-end, and interact lightly with web3 infrastructure.


Collaborate cross-functionally.
 With support from our Founding Eng Lead, you’ll work closely with Product, Design, Business Development / Operations, and our customers.


Ship fast with long-haul in mind.
 We’re a system in our infancy and so prioritizing speed and learning. You’ll iterate quickly while keeping in mind future scalability requirements.



You are




Truly ‘Senior’
. You’ve been in the industry for 4+ years. You ask “are we building the right thing?” and not just “how do I build this thing?” You have a history of working across the stack and solving complex problems while considering trade-offs between different implementations. You balance speed and control to scope and build stable solutions quickly


A communicator
. Both written and verbal. Grandma doesn’t know what React is, but she defo knows what you’re saying. You’ve been responsible for planning projects and scoping projects for yourself and others, including with PMs to manage scope and timelines for release.


A nerd snipee
. You like to dive deeply into technical matters and form a solid understanding of the space you’re working in. You’ve fallen down the crypto rabbithole.


Compatible
. You’re proficient in Javascript (ideally Typescript or at the very least comfortable with typed languages). You are comfortable with functional concepts in Javascript.  You have experience with ReactJS.



Bonus points!




A degen

Remote first

Equity
: We believe in ownership and want everyone to have a stake in our future success, that’s why you’ll receive equity when you join us.


Continuous learning &amp; opportunities
: We provide ongoing growth and development through on-the-job learning.


Flexible working arrangements

Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, a next generation purpose built database technology was announced in Preview at re:Invent 2018 and is seeing tremendous interest from AWS customers! It is a revolutionary OLTP database with highly scalable throughput. Join us during this formative period of the product and be a leader in shaping the future of Amazon QLDB.

Amazon QLDB is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log ‎of all application data changes over time. It offers a SQL-like API, flexible document data model and full support for transactions. QLDB eliminates the need for organizations to build ledger-like functionality when their applications require audit-ability and verifiability, such as, when tracking the history of credits and debits in banking applications, verifying data lineage of an insurance claim, or tracing movement of an item in a supply chain network. QLDB is serverless and highly scalable, allowing customers to scale effortlessly to support the demands of their applications.

The Developer Experience team aspires to build highly scalable, high performant data plane APIs and developer tools like AWS Console, QLDB Workbench, QLDB Drivers that offer first-class developer experience. We are looking for engineers who are customer obsessed and who can learn and dive into distributed systems and database problems to invent simple and elegant solutions. In this role, you will care deeply about customer experience and focus on building performant systems that offer idiomatic interfaces to customers. You will collaborate with a team of highly skilled engineers to build mission critical distributed systems that power QLDB’s data plane. You will have high standards for yourself and everyone you work with, you will drive engineering best practices and be constantly looking for ways to make the systems you own better. You have great communication skills and enjoy working in a fast-paced, collaborative team environment.

You will get to work in a variety of languages and with multiple frameworks to support our customers in the choices they make to integrate with QLDB. Our team writes an uses more open-source code than Amazon-proprietary code. We are a supportive group looking to help engineers grow in their careers.

About Expeto





Expeto was founded on a simple, yet compelling principle - enable meaningful IoT outcomes by transforming traditional mobile network complexity into IT simplicity. Expeto integrates mobile networks and IoT applications onto a single platform specifically designed for enterprise use cases and is sold as a service leveraging modern cloud and edge computing resources. Expeto believes that harnessing data from connected devices around the world will unlock insights that shape business strategy, create new revenue opportunities and help companies make better, more informed decisions to ensure a sustainable future.




Our people come first because it is their commitment and passion which make the difference in everything we do. Expeto is a growing distributed team with a culture of collaborative communication focused on the end-to-end customer experience. At Expeto, you will find talented people with a passion to create a highly differentiated, world-class solution through our unerring focus on platform innovation and meaningful outcomes for our customers and partners.




At Expeto Wireless, we’re solving technical challenges that the networking and telco industry didn’t realize were solvable.




Our software integrates mobile networks and IoT applications onto a single platform specifically designed for the large enterprise market and we believe that harnessing data from connected devices around the world will unlock insights that shape business strategy and help companies make better, more informed decisions to ensure a sustainable future.




As a result of the rapid adoption of our product in the market, we’re currently looking to add a few experienced Software Engineers that have “been there and done that” within the networking, telco, 4G, 5G, and/or IoT space, to help us continue the rapid evolution of our PaaS offering.




If you want to help us work smarter and faster than the giants of the private mobile networking and telco world AND be on the cutting edge of IoT…





Why should you join our team?





We asked a few of our engineers that exact question and here’s what they had to share:





“There are not many software engineering positions where you get to do heart surgery in a sense. The big carrier networks are closed. You get walls upon walls of security around that stuff. There are very few people who actually get the keys to the kingdom. That’s our gig. We are doing that heart surgery and playing around with stuff that very few people get to do.”






“Everyone wants to be a hacker. It is the ones that are actually getting into that code or those APIs, creating them and writing them. That’s what developers want to get at. That’s what we do.”






“People want what we do. They just don’t know that it’s possible.”






If you’d like to be considered to join our team, here’s what we’re hoping to see in you:






An advanced degree in Software Engineering or related discipline.

3-5 years of software development experience, preferably including large-scale telecommunications and/or networking development (SDN and NFV).

Broad experience in JVM and distributed systems.

Advanced capabilities in Kotlin, Java, Clojure, Javascript, and/or Python.

Experience using Linux, Docker, and associated tools and technologies.

Experience with agile development, continuous delivery, and deployment automation.





Although we’re a fully remote team, our preference is to hire in Canada and/or the USA at this time. Our engineers are at the top of their field, we provide them with immense challenges to solve, and we compensate accordingly.





Why Expeto?





We are excited about creating a disruptive new industry, working with people who enjoy what they do and share a passion for creating the best customer experience possible. We trust each other and rely on a leaderful organization in which people are expected to wear many hats and step up when they see a problem that needs to be solved. We are great communicators and appreciate perfect candor and the frank dialog necessary to keep us true to our vision and delivering on the outcomes of our mission.




Sustainability and efficiency are a way of life for Expeto. We believe our platform will continue to unlock new opportunities to reduce energy usage and the net carbon footprint of their operations. Join us - #Nextworking.

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a dynamic and rapidly growing business within Amazon, with millions of active customers in 190 countries around the world. We maintain a rapid pace of innovation by treating each team like its own startup inside AWS, directly accountable for their customers’ satisfaction, service innovations, ambitious growth, and meeting revenue goals.

AWS has the most services and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider–from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases–to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things. AWS Platform is the glue that holds the AWS ecosystem together. Whether its Identity features such as access management and sign on, cryptography, console, builder &amp; developer tools, and even projects like automating all of our contractual billing systems, AWS Platform is always innovating with the customer in mind. The AWS Platform team sustains over 750 million transactions per second.

AWS Identity platform provides the bedrock for secure and continuous access to all AWS services. By quickly connecting millions of users, across the world we empower organizations and enterprises to accelerate their cloud and digital transformation.

Engineers within AWS Identity need to be creative, responsible, and curious while working with others to move quickly in turning code into customer solutions. You’re excited about rolling up your sleeves, implementing ideas, and learning from those around you. You relish the opportunity to dig into challenging operational issues, fix them permanently while taking the learning back as you design the next iteration.

This specific position within AWS SignIn team represents an opportunity to design and build solutions that allow both customers and enterprises to interact with AWS consoles and services seamlessly. We support all the modern identity standards and push the boundaries to create new ones. The team works across the full stack from React based front ends to java based microservices supplanted by python &amp; ruby based tools for infrastructure builds. If you are even slightly interested in learning how to scale as business grow and want to have direct customer impact, drop us a note.

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.

We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level etc. Your manager can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

 We’ve done our job correctly when none of our users think about us, much like a vital utility. We don’t typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are exceptionally performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, we make Slack work seamlessly. Slack's backend services are written in Go and Java, and Slack's API is built on 
 PHP/Hack
 . Our 
 data infrastructure

 Design, build, ship and maintain the Edge caching services that serves ~20% of all of Slack's API traffic and is critical to Slack’s core functionality. 

 Collaborate with peers in Engineering to triage bugs and fix sophisticated production issues across the stack related to our services. 

 Whiteboard a fix to a scaling or reliability problem, then make it happen. 

 Write, review, or provide feedback on a technical design proposal from other infrastructure teams. 




You may be a fit for this role if you:





 Have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience. 

 Have built large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on. 

 Have built reliable, safe distributed systems and understand the engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either. 

 Work on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture. 

 Love to model modern methodologies for unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built 

 Are curious, inquisitive, and determined to fix things when they break. 




Bonus points





 Experience with AWS 

 Experience building and releasing software using Docker containers 

 Experience with Kubernetes 



 Edge Services is a diverse and inclusive team that is quickly growing and building the future of Slack’s infrastructure.

About The Web Platform Team



We’ve built a library of millions of books, audiobooks, magazine articles, sheet music collections, and user uploaded documents. 90% of millions of active users discover Scribd and continue to engage with content and build their libraries using our website.

We’re looking for diverse, well-rounded, communicative engineers to help empower our readers to indulge their curiosities and expand their knowledge by building quality products and user experiences. Trust, accountability, and excellent communication skills are extremely important.

You’ll consider testability, upgradeability, performance, scalability, and observability throughout the development process.

We will be responsible for prototyping and laying the groundwork for new front-end services, data layers, and single page application architectures.


Tech stack


Our online applications currently use React + Redux and server-side rendering on the frontend with Rails + MySQL on the backend. You’ll help define the future of new frontend services, as well, likely including TypeScript, NodeJS, and GraphQL.



About You




5+ years experience coding in modern consumer facing web applications

Experience working on web APIs using REST, gRPC, GraphQL, or similar

Strong experience with typed languages, backend frameworks and services (including observability and monitoring)

Familiarity with modern JavaScript frameworks such as React or Vue
