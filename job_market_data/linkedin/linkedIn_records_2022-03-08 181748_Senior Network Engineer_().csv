Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


The AWS Networking organization is hiring, and we’re looking for talented Network Development Engineers (NDE) to join our team. Within Networking, we’re confronting and solving complex and high-stake challenges. Our teams support all aspects of connectivity to/from Amazon and the outside world, as well as the connectivity between Amazon’s data centers and services. As a member of one our network engineering teams, you will play a part in designing and architecting networks that simply cannot fail, must scale infinitely, and can never constrain growth or innovation.

This opportunity sits within our Internet Services organization where the team is responsible for designing the networks connecting Amazon directly to the outside world (including the Internet, peers, and external customers), evolving the global backbone that interconnects our Regions as well as partnering with our internal customers. Engineers in this organization define routing policy, design and implement Traffic Engineering solutions, as well as architect the hardware platforms and network design to support internal and external connectivity. We move terabits of traffic in and out of our networks each day and are responsible for the ingress and egress points of traffic entering and leaving Amazon as well as the entirety of all internal and customer traffic that rides our global backbone. Engineers on this team make day-to-day and strategic decisions that carry a huge amount of responsibility and impact.



Responsibilities



As a Network Development Engineer at Amazon, your core job responsibility is to design network topologies, architectures, and services that solve for many requirements. We listen to our customers (both internal and external), but we also listen to our teams. Our Engineers contribute materially to each team’s roadmap, and constantly help us to determine what’s most important. Together, you and your leadership team will decide on the projects that best support your team’s mission. You will have the resources and time necessary to understand, scope, and deliver these solutions. The primary area of responsibility you and your team will have is to design ahead of customer or technology needs, always predicting and solving for problems that have not yet occurred. This takes the form of creating and defending High Level Design (HLD) documents, working with vendors or internal stakeholders to influence technology roadmaps, constructing and testing your solutions, and providing support to the teams that will deploy and operate these designs. Our teams also serve as technical escalation points in support of our very talented operations teams.

Key job responsibilities

An Internet Edge NDE at AWS is responsible for providing our customers world class Internet connectivity by optimizing for security, availability, performance, and cost. We do this by setting network standards and creating scalable designs that our customers love.

A day in the life

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


The AWS Networking organization is hiring, and we’re looking for talented Network Development Engineers (NDE) to join our team. Within Networking, we’re confronting and solving complex and high-stake challenges. Our teams support all aspects of connectivity to/from Amazon and the outside world, as well as the connectivity between Amazon’s data centers and services. As a member of one our network engineering teams, you will play a part in designing and architecting networks that simply cannot fail, must scale infinitely, and can never constrain growth or innovation.

This opportunity sits within our Internet Services organization where the team is responsible for designing the networks connecting Amazon directly to the outside world (including the Internet, peers, and external customers), evolving the global backbone that interconnects our Regions as well as partnering with our internal customers. Engineers in this organization define routing policy, design and implement Traffic Engineering solutions, as well as architect the hardware platforms and network design to support internal and external connectivity. We move terabits of traffic in and out of our networks each day and are responsible for the ingress and egress points of traffic entering and leaving Amazon as well as the entirety of all internal and customer traffic that rides our global backbone. Engineers on this team make day-to-day and strategic decisions that carry a huge amount of responsibility and impact.



Responsibilities



As a Network Development Engineer at Amazon, your core job responsibility is to design network topologies, architectures, and services that solve for many requirements. We listen to our customers (both internal and external), but we also listen to our teams. Our Engineers contribute materially to each team’s roadmap, and constantly help us to determine what’s most important. Together, you and your leadership team will decide on the projects that best support your team’s mission. You will have the resources and time necessary to understand, scope, and deliver these solutions. The primary area of responsibility you and your team will have is to design ahead of customer or technology needs, always predicting and solving for problems that have not yet occurred. This takes the form of creating and defending High Level Design (HLD) documents, working with vendors or internal stakeholders to influence technology roadmaps, constructing and testing your solutions, and providing support to the teams that will deploy and operate these designs. Our teams also serve as technical escalation points in support of our very talented operations teams.

We’re interested in engineers with experience having designed, operated, and implemented networks of very large scale, and those well versed in the operation of the Internet routing hierarchy. Candidates should understand the theory behind and have deep operational knowledge of routing protocols with particular emphasis on their impact to hardware platforms. We’re looking for those who have pushed platforms to their limits, understand how to work within the limitations imposed by third-party software and how to avoid them through your designs.

 Experience managing large projects to completion is a must, either as project manager or lead. NDEs are expected to self-manage several projects at a time, providing regular status updates and identifying and pushing through obstacles.




Preferred Qualifications




 Candidates should have a minimum of 7 years industry experience in a similar environment e.g ISP, peering and exchange, and large (IP) carrier networks.

 Background in high availability, global backbone design and architecture is highly preferred.

 Unix/Linux skills and the ability to script in Python, Perl, shell, C or C++ is desirable, SDN is a reality in AWS Networking. Daily activities will involve applying networking knowledge to SDN and Network Automation tools.

 Certifications (e.g. CCIE, JNCIE) a huge plus.

The pillar that supports our internal infrastructure


You're familiar with the internal infrastructure of a SaaS company? In our case, it's not the most complex, but it sure is varied! We're looking for someone to tend to our existing org, take some infrastructure projects and code a part of the time!

If you can ensure a steady setup for our teams to perform, this is a job cut out for you! Our teams are mostly versed in technologies, which can make for some interesting needs, and conversations starting straight in the core of the topic!


As a System Administrator, you will:



Build, maintain, optimize our internal infrastructure

Code (40% of the role). Scripts, small programs; we expect the role to become more and more code oriented over time (Python, Bash, Powershell, etc…)

Support the IT team with the needs of employees: if a case from Helpdesk escalates, it will be to you! 

Have some small projects to handle (24-48hrs)




Things we're looking for: 



Experience with networks. No need to have built a network, but experience in maintaining and debugging it is expected

Skills and experience in coding: it will be a part of your day.

Being able (and interested!) in working in office (Montreal or Quebec City)

You have worked in a similar role for another SaaS company? It's an asset!



You think this role suits you, and you can give it your own twist? Send us your application: we would like to get to know you!
