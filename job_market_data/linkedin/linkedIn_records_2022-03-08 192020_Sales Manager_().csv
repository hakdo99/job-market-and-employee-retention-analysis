cannot
 see? That’s where I 
really
 want to go.”

Job Description



Title: Product Manager



Reports to: VP of Product



Location: Anywhere in the USA or Canada






Job Summary


The Product Manager will lead the new FC Everywhere pod, partnering with the VP of Product, Product Designer and Engineering Manager to develop the strategy for FC Everywhere and then partner w the EM to oversee the execution of the product roadmap. The ideal candidate is a generalist, entrepreneurial PM who can move fluidly between 30,000 foot strategy, partner conversations, API reviews, user research, project management and more.





Role Context


Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). Earlier this year we acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on their technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a large product and engineering team.




As part of this investment, we are launching a new team, ""FC Everywhere"", with the mandate to build tools and platform integrations that bring FranklinCovey into the flow of work for learners and clients (original piece on ""Learning in the Flow of Work""). For learners, this could mean building personalized emails, a Slack bot, Zoom App, Teams App, or even Spotify integrations that brings FC content to the platforms and products they're already using multiple times a day. For clients, this could mean building integrations with LMSs, LXPs, HRISs, performance management or other tools to automate and improve learning assignment and measurement. The long term goals of this team are to increase participant engagement and client retention.





Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity



Build a Pod, Strategy and Roadmap from Scratch – This is FranklinCovey's first foray into learning and planning in the flow of work. You will be challenged to develop a strong point of view and a plan for executing on it. This is a high stakes/high reward, intellectually demanding, entrepreneurial role.

Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC's directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.

Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product &amp; tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.






Essential Job Functions



Strategy – Partner with the VP of Product to develop FC's strategy and approach for learning and planning in the flow of work. Evaluate market research, conduct internal and external discovery calls, review API documentation and more in order to develop strategic hypotheses and easy manual and product tests.

Design and Iterate – Partner with the Product Designer and Engineering Manager to develop the ideal approach for manual and productized tests to validate our early strategic hypotheses. Use our early tests to iterate the strategy and tactics.

Buy-In – Persuade internal stakeholders (marketing, sales, implementation specialists, solution engineers, legal, security) and external partners to participate in tests and promote full launches.

Build – Shipping is our heartbeat. Partner with the engineering manager and engineering team to ship the right-sized products to the right audiences based on the product goals.






Job Requirements



Demonstrated record owning product development from ideation to launch for products people love using (we expect this will normally take 3-5 years of PM experience to accrue but are open to candidates with faster learning curves)

Entrepreneurial background and spirit, either as a founder, early team member or experience building something from 0-1 in a larger company

Technically fluent and functional; able to review and evaluate API documentation

Clear, concise communicator with an emphasis on written communication

Strategic thinker who can develop and communicate a mental model for a problem and develop testable hypotheses

Conscientious, detail-oriented project manager who can keep everyone and everything organized towards a shared goal

Passion for education and learning at work; edtech experience a plus but not a requirement (demonstrated ability to pick up a new subject area if no edtech experience)

 Account manager. We’re looking for a Account manager to join our team but not just any Account manager. We need the really special kind.






You’re going to spend part of your day working directly with 3-5 of our clients and part of your day leading a team of coordinators and creatives – creative coordinators and uncoordinated creatives (we’re really hoping our creatives don’t read this).






The deets. Do the kids still say “deets?” Honestly, we’re not sure. We got lost at “on fleek.” Anyways, let’s get serious with a serious-looking list of what we’re hoping you have:







Laugh (or cry and laugh) at chaos:
 A lot happens in a typical agency day and it all seemingly happens at once. Whatever you thought busy and hectic was….double it. You need to be someone who thrives in chaos and can clearly see the path out.







We may be looking for (another) unicorn: 
In another life, you were probably a creative director. You can pitch and have a strong creative eye. You feel comfortable in client meetings on your own and can see the big picture. You can guide clients through initial strategic thinking, talk social and get pretty pumped about kerning. You're probably a bit of a generalist.







Experience. You've got some: 
You're going to be working directly with some pretty big, global brands. It's important for you you to understand how these organizations work and be able to navigate your way through. You're probably hanging out at another agency, looking for a new challenge or client-side yearning for some chaos. You most likely have somewhere in the 5-8 year range of experience.







Your average day: 
You'll get an email from a client with a new project. You'll whip up a brief and book an initial discovery meeting right before you jump into into an already booked discovery meeting with another client. In that meeting, you will take the lead, asking questions to better understand the need while providing some initial strategic direction.






You'll check in with your team on some outstanding items, review design before packaging it up and sending it off to a client. You then find yourself in a meeting where you'll be leading a pitch on a new campaign and then off to pull together a budget for a video. You'll wrap the day with a team meeting before grabbing a bite with a client.






Rinse and repeat but different, every day.







Customer focused: 
Human-centered design thinking is at the base of everything we do and you’re able to understand our customer’s perspective. Their happiness is paramount in everything you do and you get that. You're driven by making people happy - you may even be a little driven by making sure you never let people down.







Team leader:
 You were unanimously voted project lead in every elementary, junior high, high school and university project. You have the ability to rally the team and speak multiple languages: client, project team, creative. 







Attention to details:
 You love the details. You sweat the details and you pick up on everything that everyone else missed. Your friends and family are probably annoyed by it (but we’ll love it).







Problem solver:
 “I don’t know” is not in your vocabulary… but “I can figure it out” definitely is! Problem solving and a willingness to figure things out with minimal direction is essential. You’re autonomous, yet highly communicative. You get it done and keep everyone in the loop while you do.







One more time:
 The one above this is pretty important, so we wanted to say it again. We need the kind of person who can take something and own it; someone who wants to be involved in everything and has the dedication to follow through.







Agile:
 We’re a growing company and we’ll be honest…we don’t always have our stuff together. We’re “building the plane while we fly”, so to speak. You’ll need to be someone that can embrace this chaos on top of the typical agency chaos.







Organized: 
You love Gantt charts, scheduling and probably have a case just for your highlighters (iykyk). You've got to love autonomy and have the ability to keep yourself organized. 







Tech geek(ish):
 You get technology and are comfortable is using because, well, we use it all the time.

About your team



Your e180 team:


At e180, one of our core values is learning (“Be a knowledge gardener”). We cultivate human potential by enabling our people to learn from one another. We love to create rewarding learning experiences for our employees, clients and our community and want to increase the impact of collaborative learning around the world. We have invented Braindate, our flagship product, which helps people around the world connect with each other and share their knowledge.

Your department:

We’re not your typical sales team. That’s because e180 was founded as a social enterprise, and today, e180 is a certified (and award-winning!) B Corporation. This means that we’ve made a public commitment to leveraging our business to make a measurable difference in the world. Our flagship product, Braindate, has evolved over the years, but our mission remains the same: to transform the way that humans learn. The sales team’s pivotal role is to find and close the right clients and partners to help us do just that.





Your team’s rituals and ways of working together


The Sales team is highly collaborative: we work closely with every team at e180 (Marketing, Experience, Product, Customer Success, Development).

Our weekly meetings are a platform for discussing difficult strategic questions. We value transparency, fluid communication and openness to unexpected collaborations. e180 is ambitious and developing rapidly; the Sales team must follow the pace.

The Sales team is agile and adaptable while new avenues and business sectors perpetually unfold. We’re often remote-friendly, given that e180 is developing internationally, and we are looking for someone who is open to traveling to meet clients face-to-face when it will be possible.





Your Role


Your role as a Sales Manager will be to manage and develop a sales team. The goal of the Sales Manager will be to get maximum productivity out of their sales team by using your extensive sales experience to design Sales Plans to follow, train new and current team members and come up along with HR with improvement plans for under performing employees.

In addition to your managerial responsibilities, you will still be on the front lines negotiating deals with clients and managing key accounts. You will find and communicate to our potential clients how Braindate and other e180 services meet a growing range of real business needs. You'll identify client needs, and work with our e180 team to respond with actionable solutions. Finally, you’ll be closing deals as the qualification process bears fruit, and you’ll nurture that new partnership over time!


Tasks may include:



Hire and Train Sales Team

Create pitches and materials that best reach the target audience

Collaborate with Marketing and Experience team to design plans to attract and retain clients

Maintain a close relationship with existing clients:

Know the assigned clients inside and out and fully understand their use of our services, their objectives and their brand image;

Frequently check in with them to discuss needs, concerns, and satisfaction;

Be the first point of contact if questions or issues arise regarding the service;

Sell clients additional services aligned with e180’s new offers.

Use the appropriate paperwork when accounts come up for renewal to ensure mutually satisfying arrangements.

Collaborate with other departments to ensure e180’s offer is in line with customer requests.

Network with Potential Clients executives to generate new accounts and business.






Some extra qualities that will set you apart:



Do you have an educational background in Sales Management and Business Development Management? Good, this is what we are looking for!

Do you have significant experience in international business development, sales or even fundraising? In your position, that will be essential!

Are you experienced in the event industry and/or the impact sector? Great, it is a strong asset!

Do you have the ability to work autonomously while eager to contribute to team goals? Awesome! We can’t wait to work together!

Are you eager to build relationships with clients and serve their needs? That’ll be a huge plus!

Are you driven by challenges and result oriented? You will have a significant impact at e180!

Do you have a real desire to learn and grow? You’ll fit right in!






You’ll have the opportunity to further your knowledge about:

Client account acquisition, management and growth;

Using business as a force for good;

Collaborative learning in action;

A human-centric company culture (flexible schedule, work/life balance, having fun at work)

Unlimited vacation. Yep, when you’re a pro you’re a pro. You should be the best person to determine how many weeks off you need to be at peak performance. It’s all about balance and trusting that the right people will do the right thing.

The ""enthusiast"" zone (yes, what others call ""employees"", we call ""enthusiasts"")

Virtual activities, teamwork, and support. Even from a safe distance, we are well connected.

A company that spoils you: free hot beverages, Vitamin D, filtered water, popcorn, and dark chocolate at the office... and sometimes even at home!

At the office: large, modern, and comfortable workstations near windows. Access to a massage chair, a scooter, and a video game console. Free parking.

Powerful and up-to-date laptops with headphones and dual screens that you can bring home to be efficient and comfortable while teleworking

Virtual activity program (we work hard, but we also have fun)

A subsidized cell phone and plan for all employees

Entrepreneurial environment where you can make a difference and grow with the company

A transparent management approach where your opinion matters

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


You have super powers. Use them for good. We catch bad guys and stop online fraud. It’s fun. It’s hard. It matters. We need you.

Amazon’s Customer Trust and Partner Support (CTPS) team is engaged in a technological arms race: cyber-criminals from across the world continually look for new ways to steal from us and cover their tracks, while we invent new techniques to detect and neutralize them with ever increasing speed and scale.

It’s fun. We don’t just catch the bad guys; we stop crimes before they happen. Remember the ""Minority Report""? It’s just like that. Basically, we predict the future by developing and applying cutting-edge machine learning systems to detect, predict, and prevent online fraud before it happens.

It’s hard. This is Amazon, so of course our services are low latency, high throughput, highly scalable, and failure proof. Our fraud prevention systems are also highly reactive: we process multiple terabytes of data yet notice changes in individual behavior patterns in seconds. Even by Amazon standards, our datasets are massive and our transaction rates impressive, and everything is built with a scrupulous attention to security.

It matters. Amazon is one of the world’s most trusted companies. Consider the implications of losing that trust. Third-party sellers account for nearly half the items purchased on Amazon. This nearly always goes smoothly; but when sellers cheat buyers, everyone loses. Even after we refund their money, buyers are less likely to shop at Amazon in the future. Legitimate sellers lose potential sales and are less likely to sell on Amazon. And of course, the money Amazon pays in refunds and chargebacks goes straight to our bottom line and ultimately results in higher prices for all our customers.

We are looking for a gifted software manager to design the next generation of fraud risk management systems for Amazon.

Amazon is one of the world’s most trusted companies. Help us keep it that way.




Basic Qualifications




 5+ years of software development experience

 2+ years of people management experience

 Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related technical field (or equivalent)





Preferred Qualifications



2 years of experience directly managing a team of developers;


 Master's Degree in Computer Science or related technical discipline;

 Excellent written and verbal communication skills with the ability to present complex technical information in a clear and concise manner to a variety of audiences;

 Deep hands-on technical expertise in large-scale, cloud based distributed software design and development, more so using AWS services;

 Knowledge of professional software engineering practices &amp; best practices for the full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, testing, and operations;

 A deep understanding of the software development lifecycle, and a track record of shipping software on time;

 A passion for people management and mentorship;

 Experience designing software architectures for scalability, reliability and performance;

About The Job



We empower our product teams to solve hard problems – customer problems and business problems – in ways that our customers love and work for our business. To do this, we staff our product teams with the skills necessary to come up with effective solutions that are valuable (our customers choose to buy or use), viable (the solution works within the many constraints of the business), usable (the user can figure out how to use) and feasible (our engineers have the skills and technology to implement). While the product designer is accountable for ensuring the solution is usable, and the engineers are accountable for ensuring the solution is feasible, the product manager is accountable for ensuring the solution is both valuable and viable.

This means that product managers must contribute to their product team a solid knowledge of the various constraints of the business – constraints from marketing, sales, service, finance, legal, and privacy are typical examples. The product manager must also contribute to the product team a deep knowledge of our users and customers, and the data about how our customers engage with our products. Finally, the product manager is expected to track industry trends and the competitive landscape as they pertain to their product.

While we empower our product teams to figure out the best solutions to the problems that need to be solved, we also hold those teams accountable for the results. Shipping is necessary, but not sufficient. We look for product managers that are not afraid of signing up for results.

We are currently looking for a Product Manager interested in solving problems in the areas of student provisioning, service management, and service experience working closely with our service and tutor management teams.

Our mission is to provide support at every stage of a creative's journey; whether that's freelancing, selling their physical and digital goods on our marketplace, or being hired by some of the world's leading design-forward companies.




With many jobs, you have to pick between having a huge impact on the organization (small team) or having a huge impact on the world (big product), but at Dribbble - you get to do both, as part of a highly collaborative team, working on one of the world's top 1000 websites.

Excellent track record of driving growth and improving team performance.

Vendor acquisition experience.

Excellent communication and project management skills.

A highly goal-oriented individual with excellent communication skills.

Open mindedness, curiosity and strong problem solving skills.






Benefits:

As a workplace, we pride ourselves on doing right by our employees, and have a benefits package that makes being a part of the Dribbble team a dream job and something to be really proud of:

Work/Life Balance

We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded professional and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.
