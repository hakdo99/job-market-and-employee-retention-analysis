Founded by industry experts and focused on the appropriate application of leading-edge analytic technologies like AI within industrial operations, we believe there is a simpler, more cost, time and operationally effective way to harvest insights from the Industrial and Manufacturing data sets that already exist.

Praemo is an advanced data and analytics company that builds solutions utilized by a wide range of industrial operations. From discrete manufacturing to consumer-packaged goods to mining and process plants, our technology, RazorTM fills a critical gap. Utilizing an organization’s operational and IoT (Internet of Things) data as-is, where-is, and applying AI (artificial intelligence) tools like ML (Machine Learning), RazorTM transforms existing, under-utilized data into context relevant insights. These insights alert industrial operators to any anomaly with the potential to harm performance in time to prevent it.

Praemo is an equal opportunity employer with a proven commitment to diversity and inclusion. We are proud to have received the Platinum Seal from Diversio for ranking in the top 5% of technology companies when it comes to diversity and inclusion.

Lead Front-End Developer


Help us design and build the most beautiful supply chain solutions for the world’s biggest brands.




We’re a passionate team behind the industry’s most innovative supply chain platform used by thousands of users every day. We are relentlessly building pixel-perfect experiences that help our customers push the limits of supply chain and stay connected to what matters most.





About the job


We’re looking for someone to work closely with our Development Group to help shape and build the future of our supply chain tools and products.




You’d spend your time developing and improving existing projects and creating entirely new ideas for example:


Building new components and data-rich features on a native web-app platform

Implementing design and componentization strategies for our Product and SaaS Roadmap

Re-defining best-practices to support edge technology and frameworks

Crafting experiences and user workflows using styles and animations

Discovering ways to bridge the gaps between users and screens in both Virtual and Augmented spaces





Working together with our team, you would spend additional time programming, testing, discovering, brainstorming on hard problems, prototyping different ideas, throwing them away, and prototyping them again. You wouldn’t just be churning through tickets in a backlog – you’d be helping to design entirely new products, figuring out what exactly we’re building and why.





About you


We’re looking for someone with very strong font-end skills who is an expert in modern web components, with an solid understanding of CSS and design-first principles. More important than specific technical skills, is that you’re a strong problem solver who loves to learn – we’re not experts in everything and we don’t expect you to be either.




Here are some technologies we work with day-to-day right now:


Tailwind CSS

ASP.Net Core

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

C#, SQL

Unity

Azure DevOps






Pay and Benefits


This is a full time (40 hours per week) position. Currently our team is working mostly remote, but together we are excited about re-uniting in our beautiful new space. Moving forward we will always maintain the same level of flexibility, allowing our team to work from wherever they are most comfortable and productive. 




The salary for this position starts at $60,000 for someone with excellent UI design skills and goes up to $210,000 for someone who can really level up our team in a big way outside of purely interface design role.




We are committed to working at a sustainable and healthy pace, we will provide you any equipment you need to do your best work, including computer, external displays, office chairs, keyboards, --whatever you need.





How to apply


To apply, write something specifically for this position that tells us why we’re a great fit for each other, and what you see the future being like if we work together. Please showcase 2-3 projects you’ve worked on recently and tell us what you think we should know about them. If you’ve got anything you designed, developed and shipped entirely by yourself, we’d really love to see it and hear the story.




We don’t ask for your resume, but that doesn’t mean we’re not interested in what you’ve worked on in the past, we’re just leaving it up to you to tell your story the way you want to tell it.





A note

 as an integral support to the Dev Team, who is excited to code the future of language learning. You'll be working directly with our CTO and part of a small team.




We are looking for someone with a willingness to learn and contribute with their experience. The successful candidate will be meticulous and thorough. As a small company, we are looking for someone who can carry out back/front-end design and implementation, with minor supervision but full support.

Who Are We?





Off2Class is a SaaS tool for English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers and schools. Some of the largest online ESL schools on the web are powered by us, as well as many bricks-and-mortar programs. We are bootstrapped, founder-led and profitable.

Part of these responsibilities includes writing and debugging code, so we are looking for applicants familiar with PHP, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. You should also be comfortable using VueJS and Laravel frameworks.





What You Will Do






Develop both the backend and frontend of Off2Class Software by using PHP  (Laravel framework) and Vue.js 

Maintain Off2Class’s WordPress Blog and regularly update core and plugins 

Triage and log incoming customer/internal issues

Test new features before publication and handle bug tracking for the development team

Month 1:


You have set up the development environment.




You have reviewed the app codebase from a high level.




You understand the development pipeline from idea to release.

Month 2: 


You are working on the development and implementation of a feature with the product manager.




You are providing timely feedback on the feature specs and reporting on the development of the feature on a daily basis.




You have met with each Off2Class Team member remotely and have an overview of the role of each person in the team.




You have presented a workshop to the Off2Class Team in which you presented a topic of personal and professional interest.







 
Month 3:
 

You have a good understanding of our coding policies, have thoroughly reviewed all code to find bugs, and have made code suggestions to maintain a clean, simple codebase




You have clearly demonstrated an entrepreneurial attitude, have taken and continue to take ownership of your tasks,  and you are communicating at the level Off2Class needs to scale our product in 2022 and beyond.





Whom Are We Looking For?





We are looking for someone who thinks ‘in systems’ and is highly skilled at building repeatable processes. You think on your feet, have a roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-stuff-done attitude, and think and communicate proactively.

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is storage for the Internet.

The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to the customers.

This position is for the S3 Replication team in Vancouver, Canada. Customers use replication to make copies of their S3 objects in AWS regions.

Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds.

Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that enables customers to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere in the world. It provides all customers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to the customers.

This position is for the S3 Replication team in Vancouver, Canada. Customers use replication to make copies of their S3 objects in AWS regions. The Replication Time Control, feature of the S3 Replication, provides a predictable replication time backed by a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The S3 Replication helps customers meet compliance or business requirements for replication and provides visibility into the replication process with new Amazon CloudWatch Metrics.

However, we set these up so there are focused time periods when you are on-call and when you are not, so you can focus on your day job when not on-call.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth: We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level, etc. You can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. Besides formal mentors, we work and train together, so we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Inclusive Team Culture: We have a diverse team and drive towards an inclusive culture and work environment. Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds.

Description



Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is storage for the Internet. Through the use of pioneering techniques in storage &amp; computing, customers can reliably store their data on Amazon’s proven computing infrastructure to achieve virtually limitless storage capacity at minimal cost. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that enables customers to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere in the world.

The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to the customers.

As a Software Engineer in the S3 Distribution Plane, you will design and develop globally distributed highly available services that provide robust, safe and scalable ways for customers to route traffic to S3. You will develop these services using Kotlin, DynamoDB and SQS, on UNIX-flavored platforms.

To minimize the impact of such excursions, we have on-call rotations. However, we set these up so there are focused time periods when you are on-call and when you are not, so you can focus on your day job when not on-call.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth: We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level, etc. We can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds.

Mix of work-from-home as well as in-office (Cultivator office in Regina), depending on ongoing health restrictions. The workplace culture is fast paced and transparent as we continue to scale the BudSense product and client base. 





The Compensation 





The candidate will be required to work 40 hours per week, but time off and work hours are quite flexible. The successful candidate will receive annual compensation between $65-95k depending on applicable job experience.

Who are we?


We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 23k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Keep up with the cutting edge and adopt new technologies to improve performance and reliability




You may be a good fit if:



You’ve shipped fast and snappy web apps loved by many users

You’re excited to add new technologies to your toolbox and use them where it makes sense

You care about bringing value to our users - It’s not just about chasing the latest web API or JS framework. You understand the balance between craft and speed 

You have an entrepreneurial spirit and an ambition to scale a company

Bonus: You love art and have an eye for design and a creative mindset - A plus, if you have a portfolio, GitHub or other showcases of your projects




We're looking for both backend and frontend-focused developers! Please apply even if you wouldn't consider yourself full-stack.

Who We Are


Nuro is a robotics start-up whose mission is to accelerate the benefits of robotics for everyday life. We have an elite team of entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, and scientists. We believe AI and robotics are at the cusp of transforming daily life and we are dedicated to building meaningful products with this technology. Join us and play a critical role in our mission.


About The Role


With Nuro’s rapid growth, scaling and optimizing the development process is a top priority across the entire company. As an Engineering Productivity Software Engineer, you will be responsible for building tools and infrastructure that keep developers productive.

You will work with developers to define, instrument, and interpret key productivity metrics. Plus, you will have the autonomy to create, extend, or find tools that best address constantly changing developer needs. At the same time, you will build and scale our entire development pipeline, which involves tackling challenging problems in building, testing, and releasing code. In this role, flexibility and learning is key - you will continuously collaborate with others to identify gaps and creatively draw on knowledge across the entire software engineering spectrum to fix them.


About The Work



Collaborate with engineers across Nuro to identify pain points in the engineering process. Define, instrument, analyze, communicate, and monitor batch/stream metrics related to engineering velocity and system health.

Creatively address day to day developer inefficiencies using the best methods available . This can mean making new internal tools, extending existing tools, or introducing new tools to the company.

Build scalable infrastructure that continuously merges, builds, tests, and releases code while balancing coverage, speed, and cost. This is a challenging problem with no out of the box solution, especially due to the complexities of Nuro’s machine learning and hardware tests. Solving this requires employing state of the art techniques in areas like build optimization, intelligent test selection, and culprit finding.

Own and improve fundamental libraries e.g. APIs/clients to interact with complex systems. This includes managing code dependencies (including third party libraries) and managing the structure of Nuro’s codebase.

Educate developers on best practices and new tools.




About You



Inefficiency bothers you. The thought of taking a frustrating process and making it elegant sounds appealing. 

You can flexibly build new tools end to end to address constantly changing developer needs.

You are passionate about software engineering best practices.

You know how to build scalable and reliable infrastructure pipelines.

You are highly collaborative and care about creating the best possible user experience.

You have strong software engineering skills in Python and/or C++

You hold a Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree in computer science, software engineering, a related field, or equivalent practical experience.




Bonus Points



Familiarity with Bazel (Starlark), Jenkins, Go, SQL, and Kubernetes.

Experience with build systems and code analysis tools.




At Nuro, we celebrate differences and are committed to a diverse workplace that fosters inclusion and psychological safety for all employees.

Nuro will consider and review accommodation requests based on medical, religious, or other grounds as required by applicable law for qualified candidates.

Description



Software Development Engineer II: Lambda

AWS Lambda (https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) is changing the way we think about computing in the cloud. Serverless computing offers customers an exciting new way to create applications, turn business logic and application code into scalable, fault-tolerant production systems without requiring them to be experts in distributed systems, deployment technologies, and infrastructure management.

We are part of AWS Lambda team who is making it easier for developers to build new applications or extend existing systems using serverless technology, by seamlessly integrating services such as DynamoDB, Kinesis, S3, Kafka, ActiveMQ and SQS as ""Lambda Event Sources"". Our growing team in Vancouver has an opening for an experienced engineer who can help us extend to other data sources to help customers build data driven applications.

In this role you’ll build a new framework to simplify the user experience to add new event source to Lambda. You need create and maintain the generic interface and library which can work with most but not limited to message queue and streaming technologies. You need build large scale serverless application to control the workflow of event sources and also benchmark the security, performance, reliability and cost of each event source. Ultimately, you have opportunities to redefine the user experience for customers build event driven application with Lambda.

        Stripe’s infrastructure powers businesses all over the world. We process payments, run marketplaces, help entrepreneurs start an internet business from anywhere in the world, and more. Infrastructure engineers at Stripe build the systems that power all of our products, globally and at scale.

Our users trust us with their businesses and livelihoods, and every request that Stripe handles is critical. We process billions of dollars every year for millions of users, from the largest enterprises to a startup making their first sale. We invest deeply in the reliability of our infrastructure to earn their trust.

Stripe’s Online Database teams are responsible for the two real-time storage technologies used by the rest of engineering: our MongoDB document database and our MySQL transactional database. We have a lot of work to do: in 2021 we must make our platforms even more reliable and scalable than today, automate away the toil inherent in operating a large database server farm, empower and educate our users, and make our systems a delight to use. We’d love for you to be a part of it. We’re close to the people using our systems and we constantly get feedback that we use to make our systems better.

We have a few dozen engineers today spread across several different teams, and you’ll work with other engineers as well as product engineers who use the systems you are building.

We’re looking for people with a strong background (or interest!) in systems. We’d love to hear from you whether you’re a seasoned systems developer, or whether you’ve just learned you might like working with databases. Many of our engineers work remotely from both the US and Canada, and we’d be happy to talk to you about the possibility of working remote.



You Will




Design, build, and maintain the core database infrastructure used by all of Stripe’s engineering teams

Solve complicated problems that only exist at very high scale

Debug production issues across services and levels of the stack

Plan for the growth of Stripe’s database platform infrastructure

Develop tooling and automate processes to provide a resilient and flexible platform for other engineers

Build a great customer experience for people using your infrastructure


To get a concrete idea of what projects you might work on here, see the “Projects you could work on” section



We’re Looking For Someone Who




Thinks in systems: their edge cases, failure modes, and lifecycles

Knows their way around a Unix shell

Can debug complex problems in a distributed system

Focuses on the needs of our users, both internal and external

Holds themself and others to a high bar when working with production

Uses a metrics driven approach and can make informed decisions using data

Is able to write high quality code in a programming language (e.g. Ruby, Scala, Go)


It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t come in with as much systems knowledge.



Projects You Could Work On



We have a ton of important work to do, which is why we’re hiring! Our projects are of course changing all the time, but here are a few projects either that we’ve done in the past or are upcoming, so you can get an idea of the types of work we do. Technologies we use include: Golang, Ruby, MongoDB, MySQL, Vitess, Envoy, Kafka, and others.


Build observability and tooling to automate the management of thousands of database servers

Design and build data sharding mechanisms and infrastructure to enable Stripe’s growth over the next 10 years

Implement dynamic capacity management and rate limiting infrastructure to keep systems healthy during 10x load events

Create tools and APIs that engineers love to use to understand the performance of and optimize their database queries


What’s it like to work at Stripe?

Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.

Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.

We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.

We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.

We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.

We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).

We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.

In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.

North America, South America

Engineering at Aha!

Aha! is a different kind of high-growth SaaS company. We are the world's #1 roadmap software and help people achieve their best. Over 5,000 enterprises and 500,000 product, innovation, and engineering leaders trust our software to build lovable products and be happy doing it. We are self-funded, highly profitable, always distributed, and have no sales team. Being an always-remote company means we can hire intrinsically motivated people who love to learn, support their teammates, and want to work from where they are happiest.


Our team


Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.


We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.

We collaborate: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.

We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.

We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. 



Our technology


Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.

We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)



Your Experience



We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.

Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.


Your work at Aha!


We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. As Ruby on Rails Engineer, your work will include:


Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed

Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React

Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape

Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use

Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation 

Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency


If the Ruby on Rails Engineer role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)


Grow with us


Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. And our goal is to help you do just that. We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing. The specific benefits listed below are reflective of what we offer U.S.-based hires. We also do our best to extend identical benefits to international teammates.


Generous salary with annual profit sharing for all

Medical, dental, and vision plans — for many teammates, we cover 100 percent of the premiums

Up to 200 hours of paid time off a year to spend however you want

30 to 90 days of paid parental leave and five to 10 days of paid care and bereavement leave

Up to $1,000 annually for third-party education, along with paid time off to immerse yourself in learning

Aha! contributes a percentage of your total compensation each year towards your retirement

Description



Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, a next generation purpose built database technology was announced in Preview at re:Invent 2018 and is seeing tremendous interest from AWS customers! It is a revolutionary OLTP database with highly scalable throughput. Join us during this formative period of the product and be a leader in shaping the future of Amazon QLDB.

Amazon QLDB is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log ‎of all application data changes over time. It offers a SQL-like API, flexible document data model and full support for transactions. QLDB eliminates the need for organizations to build ledger-like functionality when their applications require audit-ability and verifiability, such as, when tracking the history of credits and debits in banking applications, verifying data lineage of an insurance claim, or tracing movement of an item in a supply chain network. QLDB is serverless and highly scalable, allowing customers to scale effortlessly to support the demands of their applications.

The Developer Experience team aspires to build highly scalable, high performant data plane APIs and developer tools like AWS Console, QLDB Workbench, QLDB Drivers that offer first-class developer experience. We are looking for engineers who are customer obsessed and who can learn and dive into distributed systems and database problems to invent simple and elegant solutions. In this role, you will care deeply about customer experience and focus on building performant systems that offer idiomatic interfaces to customers. You will collaborate with a team of highly skilled engineers to build mission critical distributed systems that power QLDB’s data plane. You will have high standards for yourself and everyone you work with, you will drive engineering best practices and be constantly looking for ways to make the systems you own better. You have great communication skills and enjoy working in a fast-paced, collaborative team environment.

You will get to work in a variety of languages and with multiple frameworks to support our customers in the choices they make to integrate with QLDB. Our team writes and uses more open-source code than Amazon-proprietary code. We are a supportive group looking to help engineers grow in their careers.

Description



Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world leader in providing a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers tens of thousands of businesses around the world! The orchestration team owns and operates AWS Step Functions, which provides AWS customers with the cloud infrastructure that makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. Building applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function lets you scale and change applications quickly. It’s a core architectural component of the critical systems for Amazon as well as many customers running on AWS.

The Step Functions service and the team is growing fast, and is innovating in big and brand new feature areas. We are looking for a Software Development Engineer to help refine roadmaps and technical direction, and follow through with detailed architecture, design, and superior code, and to drive operational excellence of a large scale distributed system. How do you know if you are a good fit for us? You are fascinated by and want to innovate in distributed fault-tolerant systems that operate at scale. You love customers. When our customers ask for the next big feature, you know this means you’ll be able to truly dig into the solution and get it done right. You love owning the project from idea to production, delivering not only in the implementation but in all phases from the kernel of an idea to quickly getting that battle-tested code into production. You enjoy collaborating with your teammates. You love working in agile programming environments and running fast to deliver evolution for your AWS services.

About Us



Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee- led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

Description



Are you interested in building tools and services to enhance the way customers create, deploy and manage their applications using Amazon Web Services? Do you enjoy working with a variety of AWS Services while developing customer-facing solutions?

AWS Service Catalog makes it easy for organizations to govern their resources at scale. Administrators can use Service Catalog to create and manage enterprise resources such as EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and RDS databases. Service Catalog gives developers and administrators an easy way to manage the lifecycles of collections of related resources, enabling enterprises to build sophisticated dev-ops solutions.

As a member of our team with Service Catalog, you'll contribute to innovative solutions for our customers that make it easy to manage and govern their AWS resources.

Work/Life Balance- Our team operates as a self-organizing Scrum team. Team members work closely with each other throughout our sprints. This way of working supports a flexible work environment for all team members. We each have different lifestyles and circumstances that require different hours of work, and team members are eager to support each other. Our team embraces WFH and team members leverage our flexibility to support diverse lifestyles. We value a sustainable work commitment, work/life balance, and we share our operations support across many team members. We frequently rearrange our commitments and work as needed to accommodate the complexities of life.

Mentorship and Career Growth- As a self-organizing team, people of different experience levels often work closely together. This enables formal and informal mentorship relationships and builds trust without our team. Team members also engage in weekly one on ones with leadership to help grow their passions and career. Team members share in making our sprint commitments and have the autonomy to pull work, providing the opportunity for diverse team members to work on different opportunities and play to their strengths. We work in fast, iterative cycles and value experimentation and continual learning more than getting a perfect result the first time. Our code reviews move in fast cycles focused on future learning, not just fixing our code. In these ways and more, our team values an environment of safety and continual improvement so we can leverage the diverse perspectives team members bring.

Inclusive Team Culture- We don't just say we value diversity. The way we work is designed to leverage the contributions of the unique and diverse talent on our team. We operate as a social network that works closely together toward a common goal. Self-organization and pull scheduling, pair programming, iterative and experimental workflows provide every team member continual opportunities to innovate, join or initiate work themselves, and contribute ideas and improvements. We avoid assigning work through a hierarchy. Team members pull work on their initiative, providing an equality of access to opportunities. Our team meetings are vibrant and engaging and team members actively seek inputs from each other.

About The Company


FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

Our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.


FLEETCOR Enjoys Global Recognition Including



 Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista 

 Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row! 

 Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking#872 

 S&amp;P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&amp;P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value) 



 Our Vision


Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.


 Our Mission


FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.


Our Strategy


FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:


 More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions. 

 More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example: 

 Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job. 

 Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food. 

 For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.


 More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships. 



 Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging

Engineering

North America, South America

Engineering at Aha!

Aha! is a different kind of high-growth SaaS company. We are the world's #1 roadmap software and help people achieve their best. Over 5,000 enterprises and 500,000 product, innovation, and engineering leaders trust our software to build lovable products and be happy doing it. We are self-funded, highly profitable, always distributed, and have no sales team. Being an always-remote company means we can hire intrinsically motivated people who love to learn, support their teammates, and want to work from where they are happiest.


Our team


Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.


We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.

We collaborate: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.

We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.

We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. 



Our technology


Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.

We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)



Your Experience



We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.

Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.


Your work at Aha!


We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. As Lead Ruby on Rails Engineer, your work will include:


Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed

Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React

Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape

Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use

Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation 

Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency


If the Lead Ruby on Rails Engineer role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)


Grow with us


Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. And our goal is to help you do just that. We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing. The specific benefits listed below are reflective of what we offer U.S.-based hires. We also do our best to extend identical benefits to international teammates.


Generous salary with annual profit sharing for all

Medical, dental, and vision plans — for many teammates, we cover 100 percent of the premiums

Up to 200 hours of paid time off a year to spend however you want

30 to 90 days of paid parental leave and five to 10 days of paid care and bereavement leave

Up to $1,000 annually for third-party education, along with paid time off to immerse yourself in learning

Aha! contributes a percentage of your total compensation each year towards your retirement

The applications have a rich set of functionality including chat, video conferencing, access management, and more.

Who Are You

The ideal candidate is a creative technologist with both breadth and depth of relevant technologies. This opportunity requires excellent technical, problem-solving, and communication skills.

Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 16 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded professional and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is storage for the Internet. The S3 Console is often the first touchpoint for many of our customers, providing the ability to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere in the world. Beyond just a frontend for S3 features, the console is a product on its own that drives overall S3 adoption and customer satisfaction. Our console helps customers understand ‘what’ they have, ‘how’ their storage is being used, and the ‘actions’ they can take based on their use cases. Our team is a mix of full stack engineers, frontend engineers, and quality assurance engineers working closely with UX and Product Management to solve challenging problems on behalf of S3 customers. Our customers come from diverse backgrounds spanning different personas, differing levels of experience, different countries, and different expectations on how they would like to interact with AWS S3.

What’s it like to work at Stripe?

Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.

Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.

We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.

We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.

We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.

We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).

We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.

In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.

Engineering

North America, South America

Engineering at Aha!

Aha! is a different kind of high-growth SaaS company. We are the world's #1 roadmap software and help people achieve their best. Over 5,000 enterprises and 500,000 product, innovation, and engineering leaders trust our software to build lovable products and be happy doing it. We are self-funded, highly profitable, always distributed, and have no sales team. Being an always-remote company means we can hire intrinsically motivated people who love to learn, support their teammates, and want to work from where they are happiest.


Our team


Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.


We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.

We collaborate: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.

We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.

We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. 



Our technology


Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.

We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)



Your Experience



We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.

Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.


Your work at Aha!


We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. As a Sr. Ruby on Rails Engineer, your work will include:


Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed

Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React

Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape

Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use

Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular 
 customer support rotation 
Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency

If the Sr. Ruby on Rails Engineer role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)


Grow with us


Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. And our goal is to help you do just that. We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing. The specific benefits listed below are reflective of what we offer U.S.-based hires. We also do our best to extend identical benefits to international teammates.


Generous salary with annual profit sharing for all

Medical, dental, and vision plans — for many teammates, we cover 100 percent of the premiums

Up to 200 hours of paid time off a year to spend however you want

30 to 90 days of paid parental leave and five to 10 days of paid care and bereavement leave

Up to $1,000 annually for third-party education, along with paid time off to immerse yourself in learning

Aha! contributes a percentage of your total compensation each year towards your retirement

Engineering

North America, South America

Engineering at Aha!

Aha! is a different kind of high-growth SaaS company. We are the world's #1 roadmap software and help people achieve their best. Over 5,000 enterprises and 500,000 product, innovation, and engineering leaders trust our software to build lovable products and be happy doing it. We are self-funded, highly profitable, always distributed, and have no sales team. Being an always-remote company means we can hire intrinsically motivated people who love to learn, support their teammates, and want to work from where they are happiest.


Our team


Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.


We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.

We collaborate: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.

We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.

We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. 



Our technology


Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We use React for rich client-side experiences on the front end. Some of the features we have built with React include:


Our fully collaborative 
text editor : Supports multiple cursors and simultaneous editing by any number of users. We also published a 
blog post explaining the underlying technology.
Our 
presentation editor : Allows users to create presentations with slide themes, shapes, text, and embedded Aha! reports (which update live so the presentation is always current).
Our 
Gantt chart : Supports scaling and scrolling to change the timeline, drag-and-drop, and quick actions to create records or sort the bars.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us, rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)



Your Experience



We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.

All of our engineers work across the full stack. As a Senior Front End Engineer, you can expect to spend the majority of your time working with React or HTML/CSS.


Your work at Aha!


We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. As Sr. Front End Engineer, your work will include:


Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed

Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React

Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape

Optimizing browser performance on screens and components that render large quantities of data to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use

Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation 

Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency


If the Sr. Front End Engineer role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)


Grow with us


Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. And our goal is to help you do just that. We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing. The specific benefits listed below are reflective of what we offer U.S.-based hires. We also do our best to extend identical benefits to international teammates.


Generous salary with annual profit sharing for all

Medical, dental, and vision plans — for many teammates, we cover 100 percent of the premiums

Up to 200 hours of paid time off a year to spend however you want

30 to 90 days of paid parental leave and five to 10 days of paid care and bereavement leave

Up to $1,000 annually for third-party education, along with paid time off to immerse yourself in learning

Aha! contributes a percentage of your total compensation each year towards your retirement

Senior Front-End Engineer - Platform




Overview Of The Role



As a Senior Front-end Engineer in Platform, you’ll help lead PagerDuty through a highly strategic transformation from a pure product to a platform. PagerDuty is transitioning from a set of products to a platform that consists of a set of configurable, flexible building blocks that can be leveraged to manage a variety of real-time work and real-time workflows. With that, we are increasing our engagement with partners integrating other tools with PagerDuty, consultants building bespoke solutions, and customers customizing the platform and creating deeper integrations to fit specific environments and specific workflows. Come help us kick off the new Platform group, which will consist of a new set of product development teams who are building the building blocks of the new PagerDuty Platform.

The Platform team is working closely with other product development teams internally who will leverage these building blocks to build new products. We’re also working closely with customers and partners to better understand their needs as it comes to platform flexibility and customizability; our larger, more sophisticated customers, in particular, are asking for a high level of customizability in terms of how they manage real-time work (such as alerts, incidents, post-mortems, security events, etc).

Since we own and operate what we build, you’ll collaborate closely with engineers across teams.

You’ll be involved in mentoring and teaching frontend skills to other engineers at PagerDuty.

Curating the frontend design system in a complex distributed system.

Developing frontend architecture patterns that scale across the engineering organization and provide better user and developer experiences

Writing unit and integrations tests

Owning and shepherding projects that our team takes on

Creating alignment among various stakeholders about a recommended technical direction




What You'll Bring




You have 10+ years experience building and managing web apps using a modern component based framework.

Deep understanding of semantic HTML and client-side JavaScript.

Have worked on distributed React apps, NodeJS required 

Knowledge about core parts of frontend engineering (state management, performance, accessibility, styling, infrastructure)

Empathy - you can clearly communicate your thoughts and opinions to others and facilitate these technical discussions to a successful outcome.

Technical Leadership experience.

Commitment to ensuring our team works sustainably and inclusively. Read more about PagerDuty’s commitment to diversity &amp; inclusion.

You have strong experience in designing and building REST APIs.

Experience with agile (scrum, kanban, lean) delivery methodologies.

Public cloud engineering on AWS (preferred), Azure, or GCP platforms.




We’re Particularly Interested In People Who




Have worked on a component library or design system before

Favor regular, incremental delivery over perfection.

Strive for continuous learning and improvement for themselves and their teams.

Are excited about ensuring that all of our systems scale smoothly.

You’ve played a key role or contributing role on architecting or building a developer platform.

Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)



Your Experience



We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.

You have helped build and operate a cloud-based SaaS product at considerable scale, and want to do it again. You have plenty of experience building infrastructure using terraform. You are calm under pressure, and respond methodically to anomalies or outages. You love the services you manage to be fast and efficient.

Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so experience working in a Rails codebase is a big plus.


Your work at Aha!


Site Reliability Engineers at Aha! ensure the platform remains stable, reliable, and secure for the world's biggest and most innovative companies. You will implement significant operations architectural features, contribute to supporting product developers, and consult with product developers whenever there is a concern about performance or scalability. Day to day, this will look like:


Setting and monitor SLOs for the organization, working with product and engineering teams to ensure they are met

Building and maintaining monitoring, observability, and autoscaling solutions for our own services, as well as those we purchase from AWS

Writing and maintaining production runbooks and operations documentation

Providing on-call operational support for production on a rotation

Assisting platform engineers in building new infrastructure services, and consulting with application engineers to help build fast, reliable features


If the Sr. Site Reliability Engineer role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)


Grow with us


Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. And our goal is to help you do just that. We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing. The specific benefits listed below are reflective of what we offer U.S.-based hires. We also do our best to extend identical benefits to international teammates.


Generous salary with annual profit sharing for all

Medical, dental, and vision plans — for many teammates, we cover 100 percent of the premiums

Up to 200 hours of paid time off a year to spend however you want

30 to 90 days of paid parental leave and five to 10 days of paid care and bereavement leave

Up to $1,000 annually for third-party education, along with paid time off to immerse yourself in learning

Aha! contributes a percentage of your total compensation each year towards your retirement

On-Call Responsibility S3 services are highly available, but there are times when we occasionally stray away from our normal operations. To minimize the impact of such excursions, we have on-call rotations.

North America, South America

Engineering at Aha!

Aha! is a different kind of high-growth SaaS company. We are the world's #1 roadmap software and help people achieve their best. Over 5,000 enterprises and 500,000 product, innovation, and engineering leaders trust our software to build lovable products and be happy doing it. We are self-funded, highly profitable, always distributed, and have no sales team. Being an always-remote company means we hire intrinsically motivated people who love to learn, support their teammates, and want to work from where they are happiest.


Our team


Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.


We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.

We collaborate: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.

We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.

We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer.



Our technology


Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), memcached (Rails caching), and Kafka. We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize. That said, some of the largest companies in the world store a large amount of their precious strategic data in Aha!, so we do plenty of optimizing too.

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)



Your Experience



We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.

We are hosted on AWS and love when we can solve one of our problems by using an AWS product directly. You will be expected to be familiar with the AWS ecosystem, and comfortable managing infrastructure with code. We use Postgres heavily, and you will be expected to coach other developers on how to get the most out of it.

Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so a meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase is strongly desired.


Your work at Aha!


As Sr. Platform Engineer, you will support the rest of the engineering team by developing abstractions, frameworks, and tools which help other Aha! engineers build the product. This includes:


Building developer tooling such as CI pipelines, local and staging environments, and helpful CLI tools. You will also assist the SRE team in building out monitoring and observability pipelines

Building infrastructure services to be used by Aha! product developers. This will usually include writing a reference architecture in our main Rails app

Working with the SRE team to write and maintain well-written production runbook and operations documentation

Consulting with application developers on performance optimization or scaling challenges


If the Sr. Platform Engineer role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)


Grow with us


Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. And our goal is to help you do just that. We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing. The specific benefits listed below are reflective of what we offer U.S.-based hires. We also do our best to extend identical benefits to international teammates.


Generous salary with annual profit sharing for all

Medical, dental, and vision plans — for many teammates, we cover 100 percent of the premiums

Up to 200 hours of paid time off a year to spend however you want

30 to 90 days of paid parental leave and five to 10 days of paid care and bereavement leave

Up to $1,000 annually for third-party education, along with paid time off to immerse yourself in learning

Aha! contributes a percentage of your total compensation each year towards your retirement

The Company You’ll Join



At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

About The Company


FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.


 $2.4B Annual Revenue 

 600,000 Directly Served Business Clients 

 2.6B+ Transactions per Year 

 8,400+ Employees 



 (as of December 31, 2020)


Our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.


FLEETCOR Enjoys Global Recognition Including



 Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista 

 Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row! 

 Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking#872 

 S&amp;P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&amp;P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value) 



 Our Vision


Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.


 Our Mission


FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.


Our Strategy


FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business:


 More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions. 

 More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example: 

 Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job. 

 Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food. 

 For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base.


 More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.

About Capital One Canada.



We’ve been helping millions of Canadians for over 20 years by providing them with access to credit. We work hard to put our customers first by providing innovative, smart solutions that make banking effortless.



Working with us
.


Capital One Canada is a data-driven tech company that just happens to do credit cards. We focus on customer-first solutions, and we’re united with this common goal. We have all the advantages of a startup, with the resources of a big company. In our dynamic, agile environment, you’ll be encouraged to have ownership over your own work, with ample opportunity for career movement and advancement.

We offer exciting opportunities for innovation as the industry becomes increasingly focused on digital technology, and the amount of data available to ground our strategies continues to grow. With your help, we will build the next generation of banking in Canada based on customer-focused values, compelling products and great engineering.

We know that the way to attract top talent is to create a fun work environment that fosters learning and career development, but we also know that you’ve got a life that’s about more than just work. We’re focused on the quality of your work, not how many hours you spend in the office. Our approach is designed to foster collaboration and innovation with a focus on agility and teamwork. We’re passionate about associates having fun, and since it’s uncomfortable to do any of those things in a suit and tie, those aren’t required either. We have a business casual dress code because we believe our associates will do their best work when they’re feeling like themselves.



We’ll invest in you and give you work you’re excited to do. 



As a new Process Manager, you’ll join the Process Manager Development Program (PMDP), which takes place over your first year with us and involves hands-on training, implementing Lean/Green Belt methodologies across two projects and presenting your work to senior leaders. You’ll also get to join fun social networking events and connect with other Process Managers across the business.


Process Managers love solving problems and making things better.


Our Process Managers are deployed across all areas of the business - Fraud, Customer Acquisitions, Payments and more - and have a huge impact on ensuring we are consistently keeping our customer promises and solving complex problems to help make us more efficient. You’re guaranteed to be part of a smart, talented team of people responsible for creating and enhancing processes that aim to deliver excellence to your customers in every interaction.

Process Managers also obsess about understanding how things work – that means mapping out business processes, understanding and mitigating business risks and ensuring we have the right controls and solutions in place – and then making them better. We work in agile, cross-functional teams so you’ll also have the opportunity to learn from other job families like Data Science, Business Analytics and Product Management too.

Check out our Virtual Job Description: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJOr5i-we_g



The Responsibilities Of Process Managers Include




Manage delivery of business processes by defining and implementing process improvement agendas, driving efficiencies, and using data to create better experiences for our customers

Collaborate with various departments (such as our agile software studio, our data scientist team or our customer service sites) in different locations to develop and execute effective and efficient processes

Apply leadership skills such as communication and change management to help drive key priorities like product launches, technology changes, and continuous improvement initiatives

Use a variety of techniques and tools to define, manage and improve processes, like Visual Management, Business Process Management, Lean, and Six Sigma

Maintain knowledge of regulatory requirements and operational procedures, and ensure documentation is relevant and updated

Develop and perform quality assurance routines, controls, and monitoring to measure and analyze process performance on existing processes 




The Basics…What We Need from You! 




Currently enrolled in, or recent graduate from (&lt; 1 year) an undergraduate degree or higher from an accredited Canadian University




The Extras…What would be great for you to have:




Experience in problem solving

Familiarity with Lean/Six Sigma/Process Improvement tools &amp; methodology

Experience in basic coding and/or data visualization (e.g. SQL, Tableau). If you know how to write code and pull data, that’s awesome. If not, don’t worry as long as you have an interest in it and aptitude for learning it.

Teamwork experience and ability to collaborate with others

Engineering

North America, South America

Engineering at Aha!

Aha! is a different kind of high-growth SaaS company. We are the world's #1 roadmap software and help people achieve their best. Over 5,000 enterprises and 500,000 product, innovation, and engineering leaders trust our software to build lovable products and be happy doing it. We are self-funded, highly profitable, always distributed, and have no sales team. Being an always-remote company means we can hire intrinsically motivated people who love to learn, support their teammates, and want to work from where they are happiest.


Our team


Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.


We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.

We collaborate: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.

We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.

We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. 



Our technology


Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We use React for rich client-side experiences on the front end. Some of the features we have built with React include:


Our fully collaborative 
text editor : Supports multiple cursors and simultaneous editing by any number of users. We also published a 
blog post explaining the underlying technology.
Our 
presentation editor : Allows users to create presentations with slide themes, shapes, text, and embedded Aha! reports (which update live so the presentation is always current).
Our 
Gantt chart : Supports scaling and scrolling to change the timeline, drag-and-drop, and quick actions to create records or sort the bars.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us, rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)



Your Experience



We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.

The Aha! security team is part of the engineering team and is product focused. As a Senior Security Engineer, you can expect to spend the majority of your time working with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript code for security reviews, investigations, updates, and implementing security features.


Your work at Aha!


We maintain security controls and perform security reviews on a broad range of features across the full stack. As Sr. Security Engineer, your work will include:


Security code reviews that go above and beyond what can be found through scanning tools (which we use too!)

Cloud and network security reviews of Amazon Web Services infrastructure that is implemented via infrastructure as code

Monitoring third-party dependency vulnerability reports and applying fixes and mitigations

Sharing security findings and new developments internally for ongoing education

Participating in security monitoring, incident response, and investigations

        Research at Stripe

Stripe’s mission is to increase the GDP of the internet and expand economic access globally. We’re designing tools and infrastructure to help our users start, run, and scale an online business from anywhere in the world. We believe there are too many barriers to doing business on the internet, and that opportunities are not equally distributed throughout the world. We also think building and growing a business online is a problem rooted in code, language, and design—not finance.

That’s where you come in: we’re looking for an experienced UX Researcher to join our growing UX Research team to collaborate with product teams to build world-class product experiences in a creative, focused environment.



About UX Research And The Role



The UX Research team is part of Stripe’s Design team and works across many types of brand and product initiatives at Stripe to more effectively and efficiently deliver products and experiences that fulfill user needs. And since Stripe’s main audience is other people who build products, we agonize over and take pride in crafting user-friendly and user-focused experiences.

In addition to conducting primary research, we also enable other Stripes (engineers, product managers, designers, operations, etc.) to learn and apply research skills to global problems. You will play a role in shaping how we build research as a core competency across Stripe and define how we put users first when conducting research.

As a UX Researcher, you will be dedicated to a product team and collaborate directly with product, engineering, and design teams. This is a full-time role based in Seattle, New York, or remote in North America. This would be an excellent opportunity for a seasoned qualitative researcher who is interested in building and applying their craft.



You Will




Lead critical research efforts and conduct complex multi-phase, mixed-method studies that deepen our understanding of the user experience and drive product strategy

Work in a highly collaborative fashion as a strategic partner to business leads, product managers, designers, and engineers to define both the long-term strategy and the short-term tactics for our products by grounding these decisions in user needs and insights

Prioritize research needs and approaches across multiple work streams to work on the right project, scale, and scope at the right time and ensure impact by delivering actionable insights

Enable other Stripes to learn and apply research skills by building research programs, platforms, and toolkits that empower them to conduct tactical research 

Partner closely with other researchers to build out Stripe’s research practice and infrastructure. Source and manage research vendors to help augment the work of the research team

Disseminate research insights to evolve and enhance Stripe’s understanding of user needs and identify innovative opportunities to meet those needs.


You may be a fit for this role if you:


Can conduct complex research at scale and demonstrate the use of a variety of research methods, which may include qualitative interviews, surveys, ideation sessions, ethnographic field research, usability evaluation, and diary studies. You might be a mixed-methods researcher, however your strength is in qualitative research

Have 5+ years relevant user research experience working on digital experiences and specialize in generating actionable insights that drive impact; with a plus if your work includes developer-focused, B2B or enterprise products

Can lead, design, execute, and communicate impactful research in a fast-paced, earlier stage product development process and know how to integrate research into product and design roadmaps

Have a desire to do hands-on research on an early-stage team, from planning and recruiting to analysis and insights delivery

Tell compelling stories and are skilled in explaining your work, process, and decisions to cross-functional stakeholders and crave feedback to help you produce your best work

Have excellent written and verbal communication skills and use them to effectively roll out large scale research programs

Relentlessly focus on users and solving for their needs and wants. You put users first and have experience driving impact from insights

Can successfully set and achieve priorities that find the perfect balance between benefiting the project, the Research team, and all of Stripe

Can balance working with urgency and focus with methodological rigor and adapt as needed for the situation

You’ve built or scaled research platforms, systems, or programs at your workplace
