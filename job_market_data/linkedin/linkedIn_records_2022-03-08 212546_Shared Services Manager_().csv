Growing into other ops, finance, or people &amp; culture work, depending on your skills and background






Ideally you would have:



At least 5 years’ experience working as an office manager, operations manager, or another operations role

An interest in working roughly 4 days a week

Finance and bookkeeping experience with systems like payroll, reconciliation, reimbursements, and payables
