About RBR


Founded in 1973, RBR designs and manufactures oceanographic instruments in Ottawa, Ontario to measure the blue planet. The effects of climate change are being seen from the ocean’s abyss to the polar ice caps and our sensors quantify this change to support better analysis, improved planning, and more effective mitigation strategies. Mounted on underwater drones, dropped out of planes, and sent to the bottom of the ocean – sometimes for years at a time – all in an effort to get precise and accurate data to support climate research, our instruments measure water parameters in some of the harshest environments on the planet. We have been fortunate to be able to partner with some of the world's leaders in the field of ocean science, like Fisheries and Oceans Canada, The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, The Norwegian Polar Institute, and The British Antarctic Survey, and we're proud to be supporting world-changing scientific research.

At RBR, our people care about the environment, our community, their work, and each other. We value curiosity, experimentation, and doing the right thing, and while we do some serious work to support cutting-edge science, we like to have fun while we're doing it. Our Ottawa team recently moved our HQ to a new space that includes large meeting spaces to encourage collaboration, a sweet snack room, a large and modern lunch area, and even a fish tank!





About the Role


We're looking for a passionate people leader to drive HR strategy and build on our unique people-forward culture at RBR. You will lead a small but mighty team of HR professionals to develop programs and initiatives that align with our values and support our mission.

You're a seasoned business partner, adept at anticipating the broader implications of HR decisions both inside and outside the business. You're an enthusiastic brand ambassador that understands how to tell a compelling, authentic, and differentiated story about what it means to build a career at RBR. You're motivated by developing people and cultivating future leaders, helping employees to create meaningful work experiences in their day-to-day.





What You'll Do:



As a key member of RBR's senior leadership team, you'll report directly to the President and provide strategic focus to HR and people-related issues and initiatives.

You'll drive improvements to workforce planning, talent acquisition, and talent management strategies to support organizational development and business objectives.

You'll connect and develop exceptional rapport with employees and be a nexus between staff and leadership.

You'll support your team in developing systems, processes, and best practices to support the organization's growth and evolution.

You'll oversee and support all HR operational activities.

You'll provide coaching, guidance, and advisory support to the HR team, employees, and leaders.

You'll lead total rewards assessments and analyses of RBR compensation, perks, and benefits programs to ensure equity, market competitiveness, and alignment with organizational objectives.

Join the Talent Management team that supports the Advertising, IMDb, Grand Challenge (AIGC) organization (one of the fastest growing businesses at Amazon).

A successful candidate is analytical, can thoughtfully approach problem spaces with the customer experience at the forefront, and build robust programs.

We are seeking a seasoned program manager with strong problem-solving skills. Must be very comfortable with using data to guide their approach.


 Program management: You have a strategic mindset and use data to guide your actions. Work backwards from business problems to build robust programs and initiatives. Build plans with clear objectives, milestones, stakeholders, and metrics for multiple programs at a time. You bring together disparate pieces of work through connective tissues

 Change management. Develop and implement scalable change management plans for key talent programs – to support the smooth implementation of changing mechanisms and processes from central teams and our team.

 Communication. Share your ideas, listen to others, follow-up, and follow-up again.

 Numbers. Data. Love them, use them. Be more than comfortable talking about them in a deep and detailed way, able to tell someone what the numbers are actually saying.

 Building relationships. Partner with HR Business Partners and corporate central teams. Share best practices, partner on solutions, and move the organizations forward together.

 Thinking big. You connect all of the pieces into a larger strategy to align people around. You push the limits on thinking about things that we never thought of before and seeing around corners.

 Resourcefulness. If you don’t know it, that’s ok. But you should know where to go for the answer or how to find out.

 Bias for Action and dealing with ambiguity. Sometimes it is not clear how we are going to get there. Can you help carve a path? How fast can you do it? What are the tradeoffs?

 Judgment. Take different perspectives and business needs, develop a solution that works, move the ball forward. Be able to support your opinions with sound reasoning grounded in the business.

 Writing. You will be responsible for regular written communications (program reviews, goals updates). Your writing must be of high quality and help show case progress.
