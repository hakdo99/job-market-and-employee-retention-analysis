We’re hiring an Operations Manager to help keep things ticking for our team of 14. This role includes responsibility for a lot of the details that impact our people, productivity, and finances – things like benefits, payables, payroll, reporting, running events, and hiring support. If you have experience helping run a software company or agency, we’d love to meet you!




We think this position would be well suited to a 4 day-a-week arrangement. Most of the work can be done remotely, though we are looking for somebody who is able to work from our Vancouver office roughly once per week.




Steamclock is a profitable and growing studio in Vancouver that makes very nice mobile apps for interesting clients like Arc’teryx. Our focus is shipping great products, and building the company we want to work at.




Like any small company, you’ll have the chance to wear many hats – ranging from administrative to team-facing, from coordination to leadership. We’re trying to build the best darn software studio in town, and your skills and perspective will help us bring that to the next level.




For 4 days a week (80% of full time), it seems like the salary range for this role should be roughly $50-70k/yr, plus our various benefits. Actual compensation will depend on experience level and the resulting level of responsibility.





You'll have the opportunity to work on:



Finance support, including: payables, receivables, reporting, and potentially bookkeeping

Managing payroll, benefits, and time off for a growing team of 14

Helping with our hiring process, especially triaging applications, coordinating interviews, and new hire onboarding

Handling day-to-day ops, such as working with vendors and building management, ordering supplies, and otherwise keeping things moving

Organizing events that invest in our team, like dinners, weekly All Hands, and employee anniversaries

Coordinating with our accountants as they prep and file year-end filings like SR&amp;ED, tax remittances, and T4s

Helping us maintain and, soon, reimagine our office space

Learning about our business, so you can help us make thoughtful decisions about how we run it

Helping us make Steamclock a really nice place to work

Growing into other ops, finance, or people &amp; culture work, depending on your skills and background






Ideally you would have:



At least 5 years’ experience working as an office manager, operations manager, or another operations role

An interest in working roughly 4 days a week

Finance and bookkeeping experience with systems like payroll, reconciliation, reimbursements, and payables

People operations experience, having worked on coordinating benefits, making sure folks take their vacation time, and hiring support

Comfort working with software like Google Sheets, accounting (we use Xero), HRIS/Payroll (we use Humi), hiring ATS (we use Workable), and Slack

Keen attention to detail and thoughtful decision-making skills, ideally in the context of a tech company

Ability to work in-office roughly once per week in Vancouver (much of the role can be remote, however)

💯 communication skills, including asynchronous communication in docs and chat

Organizational Status


UBC's commitment to continuing education is rooted in the earliest days of the university's history, but began more formally in 1936 when the Department of University Extension was formed to recognize that ""in a complex society such as ours, learning must be a continuous process through life."" Fast forward to the present, where these words still resonate and UBC Extended Learning (ExL) remains committed to this vision. Today, we work with UBC faculties, units and the wider community to provide flexible career- and life-enhancing education programs to diverse learners. It is part of our mandate to share UBC excellence in academics, teaching, and research and strengthen our contribution to learners, society, industry, and government.

Extended Learning (ExL) continues the long tradition of continuing education at UBC with an expanded mandate to provide support to UBC faculties and departments to ideate, design, develop, and support new program offerings in areas of non-degree programming, microcredentials, professional, continuing and online (PCO), career and professional education (CPE), that meet the flexibility needs of non-traditional learners.

The Program Course Support and Research Analyst Operations Coordinator is a member of the Academic Services unit and reports to the Manager, Program Development, Design and Research Academic Services Coordinator under the general direction of the Director, Academic Services.

Consequence of Error/Judgement


This position is the front-line support person for the delivery of online courses in the Academic Services portfolio; therefore, it is important that faculty/departmental requests are responded to in a timely and professional manner.

Failure to complete a project on time has ramifications for the department and Faculty, and would reflect poorly on ExL and the team. Failure to complete a project (as part of a departmental program) within an agreed-upon budget would result in shortfalls in other areas of a department's budget and overall strategy. In general, failure in negotiations and in outreach activities would negatively affect the ExL Academic Services’PDU's reputation and standing with departments and other units on campus. Work is subject to informal checks by the Director, Academic Services.
