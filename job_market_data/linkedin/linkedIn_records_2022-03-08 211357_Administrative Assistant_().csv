ABOUT THE COMPANY

Yes, we’re innovating upon innovation itself… cool, right?




[Insert hilarious meme to show you how cool we are!]

You would be working directly alongside our CEO, learning all the inner workings of Access. The idea here is that you are ambitious, looking to advance your career to eventually become a COO or other high-ranking official within the organization.




Due to the hands-on nature of this position, remote-only is not an option. You would need to be located in the Vancouver/Burnaby, BC area, or be willing to relocate.

Receive assistance with maintaining your physical and mental health (gym allowance, headspace account, flexible office hours, etc);

Be able to reach senior managers across the business, at any time;

Be able to work in a hybrid environment; and

Enjoy unlimited holidays.






ABOUT YOUR (POTENTIAL) ROLE


As an Operations Associate and Executive Assistant to the CEO, you would:


Report directly to the CEO;

Manage the CEO’s calendar;

Work with the CEO, board of directors, and investors directly;

Attend Strategic Partner meetings;

Organize Public Relations operations;

Develop and implement workflow processes designed to increase team efficiency;

Translate complex marketing, operations or product plans into tactical steps, understand and anticipate codependencies, delay risks, and manage/maintain processes, and work-streams for the business, marketing, and product teams;

Work cross-functionally with the Operations, Finance, Product, Engineering, Growth, Account Management, and Partnership teams to grow the business;

Schedule events; and

Assist in managing multiple teams.






ABOUT YOU


What makes you different from other applicants is:


Your attention to detail;

Your organizational skills;

Your time management skills;

Your clear and concise communication skills;

Your ability to think on your feet;

Your enthusiasm;

Your can-do attitude;

Your patience;

Your social and emotional intelligence;

Your superior mediation skills;

Your ability to keep calm in a crisis;

Your background in business and/or tech; and

Your self-motivation.






ABOUT YOUR SUCCESS


The impact of your success cannot be overstated. This is a full-time permanent position. This role will help shape not just the future of our organization, but also your place within it and your career trajectory. As a result, we really want to make sure the right candidate is selected. If you still think that’s you after reading everything above, we very much look forward to your submission.




We’re on a mission: to help innovators connect and scale.

This is a mandatory requirement and failure to complete the attestation will result in you being non-compliant for the position and we will therefore be unable to move forward in the hiring process.



Le gouvernement fédéral a mis en place une politique de vaccination obligatoire pour les fonctionnaires et tout le personnel des entrepreneurs qui ont accès aux lieux de travail du gouvernement du Canada. En tant qu'employé ou entrepreneur indépendant de Calian effectuant des travaux pour des clients de Calian appartenant au gouvernement fédéral, vous serez soumis à ce mandat.
