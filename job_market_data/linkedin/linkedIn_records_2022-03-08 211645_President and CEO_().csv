An outstanding communicator and exceptional relationship builder, the incoming CEO will open doors for Jack.org, continue to focus on Jack.org’s two core pillars of de-stigmatization of mental health and peer-to-peer education, and will provide clarity and direction on Jack.org’s growing advocacy work.
