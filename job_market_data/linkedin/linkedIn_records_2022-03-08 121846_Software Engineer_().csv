About HashiCorp



At HashiCorp, we’re building a generation-defining infrastructure software company, powered by our core principles and a growing team of talented, committed professionals working together to help organizations seamlessly transition to and operate in the cloud. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in San Francisco, 85 percent of our employees work remotely, strategically distributed around the globe. From our inception we built the company with a remote-first approach because we believe talent has no boundaries.

The Terraform Platform Engineering group is composed of Site Reliability Engineers and distributed systems engineers working on the Terraform Cloud hosted service. Our group ensures that the platform’s underlying infrastructure, data stores, and core foundational services are reliable, performant, and robust. We work closely with the engineering teams that ship features for both Terraform Cloud and the Terraform Enterprise on-premise product. Together, we comprise the Terraform Commercial organization within engineering.

We’re looking to create a new team focused on enabling Terraform Commercial’s 50+ engineers to be more efficient and productive in their work. This team will be focused on three areas: 
DevTools and test environments
, 
build and release pipelines
 (CI/CD, release engineering, etc.), and 
test harnesses and infrastructure
.



This Is a Unique Opportunity For An Experienced Engineer To Help Define The Vision For a New Team That Will Have Tremendous Impact Within Our Group, Seeking Answers To Questions Like




How can we prevent developers from being distracted by flaky tests or a lack of standardized test methodology across our services?

How can we minimize time spent between code commit and production deploy, without sacrificing quality or reliability?

How do we accurately verify changes in our test and staging environments, so we can be confident that a production deploy will be successful?


If this sounds like an interesting opportunity, we’d love to meet you! We have a large footprint and a quickly-growing user base, with lots of interesting problems and plenty of opportunities for growth and development.



Responsibilities




In this role, you can expect to:



Think critically about the current challenges of a high-delivery engineering organization, and develop novel solutions

Jointly develop and execute on a roadmap for solving identified challenges 

Work closely with engineering leaders and managers within our group, and other teams within the company focused on quality and reliability

Grow into a technical leader for a new discipline for our organization




Requirements




You’re a great fit if you have:



Informed opinions (from prior experience) about:


Test methodology and tooling for Go and Rails (RSpec, etc.)

CI / CD tools and build + release pipelines

Test infrastructure and systems supporting complex distributed systems, with several services and codebases 


Experience as a software engineer implementing, testing, and debugging unit tests for Rails and Go applications

Desire to think strategically about these sort of challenges, and jointly develop a vision, roadmap, etc. for a team to execute

Ability to alternate between big-picture thinking and roll-up-your-sleeves engineering work

A passion for focusing work on unblocking others and empowering engineers to do their best work

Comfort working across several Go and Rails codebases


How We Work

At HashiCorp, we operate according to a strong set of company principles, many of which are described in The Tao of HashiCorp. We value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers.

Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team, and this role is no exception. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy.

Company Description



Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.



Job Description

You will be part of a team who partners closely with other mobile platform teams to support the entire mobile development lifecycle as well as all the mobile product engineering teams. This is a high force multiplier, cross-functional team aiming to enhance the development experience for all mobile developers within Square.



You Will




 Develop and maintain frameworks for high level testing capabilities.

Develop tooling and metrics to understand what is being tested and how it is tested.

Maintain and optimize the infrastructure to run tests both locally and on CI.

Create and evangelize processes to help enforce test quality.

Own the success of your team's projects, and deliver quantifiable results.

Work with world-class, experienced, and dedicated engineers.




Qualifications




Have at least 3+ years of experience working in the iOS ecosystem.

Be proficient in Objective-C or Swift for development (we use both).

Enjoy working on mobile apps at all levels – from networking up to user interfaces and whatever's in between.

Respond to customer feedback to improve our frameworks and tools.

Have an eagerness to share your ideas, and openness to those of others.

Quickly and easily articulate issues and what needs to be done to resolve them

About Us


August is about people. Our partners, our clients and our team make up the lifeblood of our company. We value personal accountability, encourage open, critical thinking and embrace diversity. Most importantly we're interested in how technology can solve the challenges they face.




We help clients across industries adapt and excel in the digital era by offering innovative solutions to challenges across web, mobile, and emerging platforms. Our clients and projects range in scope, industry and size but our commitment to deliver digital solutions to address our customers' needs are a constant.




Full-stack development requires a broad skillset. The best candidates will demonstrate substantial experience within each of the several areas outlined below. Where a 
web developer
 tends to be specialized in either front-end or back-end development, a 

full-stack engineer 

will be proficient across the board, including any associated areas such as database design/management and DevOps.





Full-Stack Developer


The key to exceptional front-end engineering is a thorough understanding of user experience, and in turn, user interface implementation. The latter requires a comprehensive understanding of various front-end technologies, the core being HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is also beneficial for the engineer to be familiar with various frameworks and libraries, but the specific ones are down to personal preference. It’s a bonus to have an appreciation/understanding of product strategy.




Back-end engineering does not require an understanding of user experience, 
per se
. However, it does demand extensive knowledge of API principles. This does not necessarily have to be REST, but in most cases, this is the preferred paradigm. In addition to this, the candidate must excel in at least one back-end technology as well as database design and implementation. It is also important that the candidate holds more than just a basic understanding of managing relevant infrastructure.





The Role


We are looking for a seasoned full-stack engineer to join our growing team. As an integral part of the technical team, S/He will collaborate with a small team of developers and designers, along with the support and direction of the Technical Lead and Project Manager to build great products for our clients. Successful candidates will have a minimum of five years’ recent experience with all of the skills listed below.





Responsibilities:



Analyze user needs and develop software solutions

Work with the project manager or product owner to meet specification needs

Design and implementation of the overall web architecture

“Pixel-perfect” implementation of our approved user interface

Recommend software upgrades to optimize operational efficiency

Collaborate with other developers to design and optimize code

Create flowcharts and user guides for new and existing programs

Document all programming tasks and procedures

Perform routine software maintenance

Design overall architecture of web applications.

Handle responsive design, accessibility and mobile requirements, leveraging best practices and modern frameworks.

Develop test strategies, design automation frameworks, write unit/integration tests to drive up code coverage, automation metrics, security and data protection

Interact with business partners, teammates, internal users and external users regarding cost estimations, timelines, technical issues, and infrastructure support both pre- and post-production

Utilize disciplined coding practices and concepts to enable agility and delivery of high-quality code that is maintainable and reusable

Update progress daily through Project Management tracking tool (ex. Jira) or Kanban/Agile board.

Design and develop APIs and SDKs for our services or products






Qualifications:



Experience (5+ years) in software development, computer engineering, or other related fields

Experienced (3+ years) with NodeJS, Vue or other back-end programming languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, etc)

Experience (at least 3 years) with ReactJS and other front-end frameworks (advanced JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as AngularJS, KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, DurandalJS etc.)

Experience (5+ years) building on WordPress (NICE TO HAVE)

Database design and management, including being up on the latest practices and associated versions and familiarity with relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server

Knowledge of GIit code versioning

Engagement and exposure to the full software development life cycle

Deadline and detail-oriented

familiarity with CSS preprocessors, bundlers, and associated languages/syntaxes/libraries ( e.g., Sass, Less, and webpack)

Thorough understanding of user experience and possibly even product strategy

Experience implementing testing platforms and unit tests






Perks



A competitive base salary package

Paid time off: vacation, public holidays, office is closed between Christmas and New Years

Full health and dental benefits

Remote Work Policy

Company parties in the summer, winter, and a few fun events in between

Engaging, fun, and casual company culture

 We operate at tremendous scale with systems that process millions of events per second.


 Edge services 

 Data Stores and Caches 

 Real-time messaging and event fanout 

 Asynchronous background job processing 



 We’ve done our job correctly when none of our users think about us, much like a vital utility. We don’t typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are exceptionally performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, we make Slack work seamlessly. Slack's backend services are written in Go and Java, and Slack's API is built on 
 PHP/Hack
 . Our 
 data infrastructure
 is built on Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Presto, Spark, and MySQL/Vitess. 





The Edge Services Team





 We are a small team building critical services that enable Slack to scale for our largest customers. Flannel, our edge cache, powers the most latency critical queries for our largest entities today. 



 We power core Slack functionality such as shared channels, our privacy-preserving image proxy, and many other key day-to-day parts of our customer’s experience. We have a strong commitment to quality and understand that simplicity and reliability are the foundations of our work. 



 We are actively building the future of edge caching at Slack, so we can support a growing number of customers without increasing complexity. 




If You Were To Join Slack, Here Are The Types Of Things You Would Do Over The Course Of a Typical Week




 Design, build, ship and maintain the Edge caching services that serves ~20% of all of Slack's API traffic and is critical to Slack’s core functionality. 

 Collaborate with peers in Engineering to triage bugs and fix sophisticated production issues across the stack related to our services. 

 Whiteboard a fix to a scaling or reliability problem, then make it happen. 

 Write, review, or provide feedback on a technical design proposal from other infrastructure teams. 




You may be a fit for this role if you:





 Have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience. 

 Have built large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on. 

 Have built reliable, safe distributed systems and understand the engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either. 

 Work on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture. 

 Love to model modern methodologies for unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built 

 Are curious, inquisitive, and determined to fix things when they break. 




Bonus points





 Experience with AWS 

 Experience building and releasing software using Docker containers 

 Experience with Kubernetes 



 Edge Services is a diverse and inclusive team that is quickly growing and building the future of Slack’s infrastructure. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each other’s growth and it’s not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas from the beginning. 



 Come join us! 


Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?

Company Description



Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.



Job Description



Retailers have struggled too long with clunky, outdated and disconnected tools. Even as mammoth Retail and e-commerce forces threaten to disrupt smaller merchants, we are empowering those merchants with simple and elegant solutions to complex problems - like predictive analytics and fluid, omni-channel capabilities to meet customers wherever they are - to always make the sale.

Square for Retail is a growing product team based out of New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Atlanta. We benefit from (and contribute to) the resources of the larger organization while staying focused on solving Retail-specific challenges. We are relentlessly customer focused, and iterate quickly using a build-measure-learn approach.

About Netskope



Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

 PHP/Hack

 Have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience. 

 Have built large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on. 

 Have built reliable, safe distributed systems and understand the engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either. 

 Work on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture. 

 Love to model modern methodologies for unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built 

 Are curious, inquisitive, and determined to fix things when they break.

We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. Our team is located in the Seattle office but we're flexible when team members need to occasionally work from home. We generally keep core in-office hours from 10am - 5pm.

On-Call Responsibility: S3 services are highly available, but sometimes we occasionally stray away from our normal operations. To minimize the impact of such excursions, we have on-call rotations. However, we set these up so there are focused time periods when you are on-call and when you are not, so you can focus on your day job when not on-call.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth: We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level, etc. You can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. Besides formal mentors, we work and train together, so we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Inclusive Team Culture: We have a diverse team and drive towards an inclusive culture and work environment. Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Our team members are active in Amazon’s 10+ affinity groups, sometimes known as employee resource groups, which bring employees together across businesses and locations around the world. These range from groups such as the Black Employee Network, Amazon Women and Engineering, and LGBTQ+

Nurture your passion to pioneer.





We are FlowPoint Technologies Ltd., and we exist to make loan compliance and data management look easy with a platform that converges all of the files between lenders and borrowers to a single location. Instead of letting companies struggle to locate sensitive files between multiple cloud accounts and overflowing desktop folders, FlowPoint allows businesses to focus energies on what matters – their business.




And yes, we make it look like magic, but it’s not. It takes a terrific team of like-minded professionals who are fueled by working on the razor’s edge in data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence. Why? Because we’re building a simple software solution for a big problem – and that takes brainpower. We have a passion to pioneer the next generation of loan monitoring and compliance, and we are constantly building out new products that keep us ahead of the curve and the competition. We believe in empowering our teammates with the tools, mentorship, and support to take document-sharing from being a burden to being a breeze.




One of our greatest strengths is having true direction and purpose – we’re not trying to be a jack of all trades, we want to be the master of one. With a C-Suite stacked full of industry veterans that know the ropes of the startup world, we have the freedom and confidence to bring our great ideas to life without any of the mishaps that come with inexperience. Together, we will create change that truly benefits our clients in a space that is yet untouched by the fintech industry.

You will be trusted with some of the most important and impactful work of your career.

It’s an investment in your future and ours.





You will converge great ideas. 





You may never find another startup that takes collective learning as seriously as we do.

You are joining a small but rapidly growing team which means you’re entering on the ground-level and getting serious facetime with seasoned champions who have already spent decades building and selling successful businesses.





You will conquer the competition.

You will be a market leader in streamlining finance relationships through technology. FlowPoint services a group whose needs are known but often ignored; it is a jack of no trades, master of one – as such, you will always know exactly what you’re doing and what it takes to get there. Let your ambitions be energized. And hey, we’re all human here. You’re pioneering a first-of-its-kind solution, so if you need to take a minute to slow down, catch your breath, and regroup, then you go take care of yourself, no questions asked.





Perks and Benefits 






A C-Suite with strong technical backgrounds and plenty of mentorship capacity

A fully-equipped home office setup

Equity in the company

Free subscriptions to countless certification programs

Pioneering tech for a problem the market hasn’t addressed

They also provided me with subscriptions to learning sites to make sure I would get the professional growth I needed. They are very supportive.""

About Expeto





Expeto was founded on a simple, yet compelling principle - enable meaningful IoT outcomes by transforming traditional mobile network complexity into IT simplicity. Expeto integrates mobile networks and IoT applications onto a single platform specifically designed for enterprise use cases and is sold as a service leveraging modern cloud and edge computing resources. Expeto believes that harnessing data from connected devices around the world will unlock insights that shape business strategy, create new revenue opportunities and help companies make better, more informed decisions to ensure a sustainable future.




Our people come first because it is their commitment and passion which make the difference in everything we do. Expeto is a growing distributed team with a culture of collaborative communication focused on the end-to-end customer experience. At Expeto, you will find talented people with a passion to create a highly differentiated, world-class solution through our unerring focus on platform innovation and meaningful outcomes for our customers and partners.




At Expeto Wireless, we’re solving technical challenges that the networking and telco industry didn’t realize were solvable.




Our software integrates mobile networks and IoT applications onto a single platform specifically designed for the large enterprise market and we believe that harnessing data from connected devices around the world will unlock insights that shape business strategy and help companies make better, more informed decisions to ensure a sustainable future.




As a result of the rapid adoption of our product in the market, we’re currently looking to add a few experienced Software Engineers that have “been there and done that” within the networking, telco, 4G, 5G, and/or IoT space, to help us continue the rapid evolution of our PaaS offering.




If you want to help us work smarter and faster than the giants of the private mobile networking and telco world AND be on the cutting edge of IoT…





Why should you join our team?





We asked a few of our engineers that exact question and here’s what they had to share:





“There are not many software engineering positions where you get to do heart surgery in a sense. The big carrier networks are closed. You get walls upon walls of security around that stuff. There are very few people who actually get the keys to the kingdom. That’s our gig. We are doing that heart surgery and playing around with stuff that very few people get to do.”






“Everyone wants to be a hacker. It is the ones that are actually getting into that code or those APIs, creating them and writing them. That’s what developers want to get at. That’s what we do.”






“People want what we do. They just don’t know that it’s possible.”






If you’d like to be considered to join our team, here’s what we’re hoping to see in you:






An advanced degree in Software Engineering or related discipline.

3-5 years of software development experience, preferably including large-scale telecommunications and/or networking development (SDN and NFV).

Broad experience in JVM and distributed systems.

Advanced capabilities in Kotlin, Java, Clojure, Javascript, and/or Python.

Experience using Linux, Docker, and associated tools and technologies.

Experience with agile development, continuous delivery, and deployment automation.





Although we’re a fully remote team, our preference is to hire in Canada and/or the USA at this time. Our engineers are at the top of their field, we provide them with immense challenges to solve, and we compensate accordingly.





Why Expeto?





We are excited about creating a disruptive new industry, working with people who enjoy what they do and share a passion for creating the best customer experience possible. We trust each other and rely on a leaderful organization in which people are expected to wear many hats and step up when they see a problem that needs to be solved. We are great communicators and appreciate perfect candor and the frank dialog necessary to keep us true to our vision and delivering on the outcomes of our mission.




Sustainability and efficiency are a way of life for Expeto. We believe our platform will continue to unlock new opportunities to reduce energy usage and the net carbon footprint of their operations. Join us - #Nextworking.

More About Hopper



Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:


 Hopper’s valuation is now over $ 5B . The company’s valuation has more thantripled since early 2020.

 The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

 According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

 Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT.

 The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually

 Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

 Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip.

 The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.


All this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!

 We operate at tremendous scale with systems that process millions of events per second.


 Edge services 

 Data Stores and Caches 

 Real-time messaging and event fanout 

 Asynchronous background job processing 



 We’ve done our job correctly when none of our users think about us, much like a vital utility. We don’t typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are exceptionally performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, we make Slack work seamlessly. Slack's backend services are written in Go and Java, and Slack's API is built on 
 PHP/Hack
 . Our 
 data infrastructure
 is built on Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Presto, Spark, and MySQL/Vitess. 





The Edge Services Team





 We are a small team building critical services that enable Slack to scale for our largest customers. Flannel, our edge cache, powers the most latency critical queries for our largest entities today. 



 We power core Slack functionality such as shared channels, our privacy-preserving image proxy, and many other key day-to-day parts of our customer’s experience. We have a strong commitment to quality and understand that simplicity and reliability are the foundations of our work. 



 We are actively building the future of edge caching at Slack, so we can support a growing number of customers without increasing complexity. 




If You Were To Join Slack, Here Are The Types Of Things You Would Do Over The Course Of a Typical Week




 Design, build, ship and maintain the Edge caching services that serves ~20% of all of Slack's API traffic and is critical to Slack’s core functionality. 

 Collaborate with peers in Engineering to triage bugs and fix sophisticated production issues across the stack related to our services. 

 Whiteboard a fix to a scaling or reliability problem, then make it happen. 

 Write, review, or provide feedback on a technical design proposal from other infrastructure teams. 




You may be a fit for this role if you:





 Have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience. 

 Have built large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on. 

 Have built reliable, safe distributed systems and understand the engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either. 

 Work on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture. 

 Love to model modern methodologies for unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built 

 Are curious, inquisitive, and determined to fix things when they break. 




Bonus points





 Experience with AWS 

 Experience building and releasing software using Docker containers 

 Experience with Kubernetes 



 Edge Services is a diverse and inclusive team that is quickly growing and building the future of Slack’s infrastructure. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each other’s growth and it’s not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas from the beginning. 



 Come join us! 


Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?

 Edge services 

 Data Stores and Caches 

 Real-time messaging and event fanout 

 Asynchronous background job processing 



 We’ve done our job correctly when none of our users think about us, much like a vital utility. We don’t typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are exceptionally performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, we make Slack work seamlessly. Slack's backend services are written in Go and Java, and Slack's API is built on 
 PHP/Hack
 . Our 
 data infrastructure

 We power core Slack functionality such as shared channels, our privacy-preserving image proxy, and many other key day-to-day parts of our customer’s experience. We have a strong commitment to quality and understand that simplicity and reliability are the foundations of our work. 



 We are actively building the future of edge caching at Slack, so we can support a growing number of customers without increasing complexity. 




If You Were To Join Slack, Here Are The Types Of Things You Would Do Over The Course Of a Typical Week




 Design, build, ship and maintain the Edge caching services that serves ~20% of all of Slack's API traffic and is critical to Slack’s core functionality. 

 Collaborate with peers in Engineering to triage bugs and fix sophisticated production issues across the stack related to our services. 

 Whiteboard a fix to a scaling or reliability problem, then make it happen. 

 Write, review, or provide feedback on a technical design proposal from other infrastructure teams. 




You may be a fit for this role if you:





 Have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience. 

 Have built large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on. 

 Have built reliable, safe distributed systems and understand the engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either. 

 Work on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture. 

 Love to model modern methodologies for unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built 

 Are curious, inquisitive, and determined to fix things when they break. 




Bonus points





 Experience with AWS 

 Experience building and releasing software using Docker containers 

 Experience with Kubernetes 



 Edge Services is a diverse and inclusive team that is quickly growing and building the future of Slack’s infrastructure. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each other’s growth and it’s not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas from the beginning. 



 Come join us! 


Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?

Job Description



About The Team and Our Work


Our status as a world-class VFX facility has been achieved through the development of industry-leading software which empowers our artists to create stunning imagery. We have curated a considerable portfolio of off-the-shelf and in-house software to meet these unique requirements, and continue to evolve and improve our technology as new needs emerge. The Core Engineering team operates within a larger R&amp;D division to provide the business critical infrastructure that enables multiple projects with thousands of shots to be simultaneously completed across the globe efficiently and to the highest quality.

A blend of globally distributed software, systems and operations experts, we are responsible for building and maintaining key infrastructure and services in collaboration with site-local engineering teams and other specialized development teams. With users in all areas of the company, our solution (the Core Platform) is based on a distributed micro-services environment providing capabilities in areas such as compute, storage, sync, and digital asset management. Development and operational support spans the stack from operating system through to desktop/web application front-ends.

Work with your colleagues to fix bugs, develop features, and define new services from start to finish.

Advocate for professional standards of development.

Troubleshoot problems across different levels of the stack, and in production environments.

Take responsibility for code quality, always leaving projects in better state than before you started work.

Contribute to maintaining an authoritative source of documentation.

Evangelise use of the Core Platform within MPC and other Technicolor business units.

Take initiative to improve the developer experience in small or large ways.

Provide some level of operational support for the platform as required.



About You

Job Description



About The Team and Our Work


Our status as a world-class VFX facility has been achieved through the development of industry-leading software which empowers our artists to create stunning imagery. We have curated a considerable portfolio of off-the-shelf and in-house software to meet these unique requirements, and continue to evolve and improve our technology as new needs emerge. The Core Engineering team operates within a larger R&amp;D division to provide the business critical infrastructure that enables multiple projects with thousands of shots to be simultaneously completed across the globe efficiently and to the highest quality.

A blend of globally distributed software, systems and operations experts, we are responsible for building and maintaining key infrastructure and services in collaboration with site-local engineering teams and other specialized development teams. With users in all areas of the company, our solution (the Core Platform) is based on a distributed micro-services environment providing capabilities in areas such as compute, storage, sync, and digital asset management. Development and operational support spans the stack from operating system through to desktop/web application front-ends.

In recognition of the flexibility, scalability and maturity of the Core Platform that has been created by the team for MPC, we have been tasked with establishing the Core Platform elsewhere, making it available to other business units that are part of Technicolor’s portfolio.


About The Role


As a Software Developer in the Core Engineering team, your role is to further the development of the Core Platform to meet the needs of our users and the wider business.

You will draw on your skills and experience to both extract and modernise the Core Platform for use by other Technicolor companies, and to maintain ongoing use by MPC. You will focus on developing services and APIs that encapsulate the business logic of the platform, in areas such as compute, storage, digital asset management and digital resource management. You will be building internally facing interfaces to our platform and production data.

The Core Platform has a broad scope and diverse user group. While there is some expectation of the role to work across multiple aspects of the platform (building features, fixing bugs, general enhancements), some developers do specialise and focus on specific subject areas. This may happen immediately, or after some time having gained familiarity with many areas of the platform.


Your Responsibilities


In this role, your responsibilities will include;


Work with your colleagues to develop features, fix bugs, and define new services from start to finish.

Advocate for professional standards of development.

Troubleshoot problems across different levels of the stack, and in production environments.

Take responsibility for code quality, always leaving projects in better state than before you started work.

Contribute to maintaining an authoritative source of documentation.

Evangelise use of the Core Platform within MPC and other Technicolor business units.

Take initiative to improve the developer experience in small or large ways.

Provide some level of operational support for the platform as required.



About You



Qualifications


To succeed in the role, the following experience and competencies are required;


Production-level experience using Python for desktop applications, service backends or development infrastructure.

An understanding of concurrency as it applied to CPython, and writing code that scales gracefully.

Strong knowledge of microservices architecture, design and implementation.

SQL and general database knowledge for query writing and optimisation.

A working understanding of HTTP and JSON.

Familiarity with source control, in particular Git, and associated best practices.

Comfortable working in a primarily Linux based development and runtime environment.

Solid knowledge of testing principles, in particular TDD and/or BDD.

Proven problem-solving skills around technical, product and business requests.

Be able to consider a technical solution from different perspectives, including algorithms, complexity, correctness, maintainability.

Excellent verbal and written communication skills.

Be self-motivated and demonstrate strong organisational skills.


Previous experience in the VFX industry is not required to be successful in this role.


Nice to Have


The following are not essential to be successful in the role, however prior experience or the desire to grow in these areas will be of benefit;


Knowledge of the various components used to develop micro-service frameworks (such as uWSGI, NGINX, RabbitMQ and Flask).

Knowledge in k8/Kubernetes and Docker.

Knowledge of monitoring tools (such as Prometheus, Alert Manager, Grafana and Graylog).

Understanding of CI/CD best practices and advocate for their use and improvement.

Cross-platform development on Windows and OS X.

Knowledge of Python packages and frameworks such as Flask, PyQt, PyMySQL, etc.

Experience of Agile and lean methodologies, and an interest in process improvement in these areas.

Comfortable working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment where requirements change.

Able to present technical concepts to a broad audience with varying level of technical understanding.

An awareness of security and keeping content secure.

Slack's backend services are written in Go and Java, and Slack's API is built on 
 PHP/Hack
 . Our 
 data infrastructure

 Whiteboard a fix to a scaling or reliability problem, then make it happen. 

 Write, review, or provide feedback on a technical design proposal from other infrastructure teams.

 Have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience. 

 Have built large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on. 

 Have built reliable, safe distributed systems and understand the engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either. 

 Work on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture. 

 Love to model modern methodologies for unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built 

 Are curious, inquisitive, and determined to fix things when they break. 




Bonus points





 Experience with AWS 

 Experience building and releasing software using Docker containers 

 Experience with Kubernetes 



 Edge Services is a diverse and inclusive team that is quickly growing and building the future of Slack’s infrastructure. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each other’s growth and it’s not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas from the beginning. 



 Come join us! 


Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day.

You will also mentor engineers, passing-on your hard-earned knowledge and skill to more junior members of your team.

Together, you and your engineering teammates, technical and product managers will work to invent the next generation of purchase order services at Amazon, and to improve the way that we source and procure inventory for Earth's most customer-centric company.

Our sellers depend on us to give them a platform to launch their business into every home and marketplace. Making this happen for all customers around the world is the mission of every member of the Amazon International Technology &amp; Expansion team.

The ask is simple: make everything available to everyone all the time at the best possible price across the globe. The implementation is not - so we’re looking for leaders who aren’t afraid of tackling massive scale, layered complexity and ambiguous problems to empower our customers to shop the World. No two features are ever the same and our customers are hungry for every single one!

About The Team



The Amazon International Expansion team in Canada is small group (20-30 people primarily in Vancouver) of experienced Amazonians who tackle complex/ambiguous problems everyday. We keep our on-call load low, so we can focus on solving bigger picture problems. We are a social group and generally organize a team event at least once per month.

Company Description



Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.



Job Description



Retailers have struggled too long with clunky, outdated and disconnected tools. Even as mammoth Retail and e-commerce forces threaten to disrupt smaller merchants, we are empowering those merchants with simple and elegant solutions to complex problems - like predictive analytics and fluid, omni-channel capabilities to meet customers wherever they are - to always make the sale.

Square for Retail is a growing product team based out of New York, San Francisco, Toronto, and Atlanta as well as some fully remote team members. All of our teams have Android, iOS, Frontend, and Server engineers allowing us to design, build, and ship features across our Point of Sale clients on iOS and Android, our seller facing tools on the web, and our backend platforms. We benefit from (and contribute to) the resources of the larger organization while staying focused on solving Retail-specific challenges. We are relentlessly customer focused, and iterate quickly using a build-measure-learn approach.



You Will




Develop for our custom, purpose-built hardware - Square Register - with dual displays;

Be a part of creating an innovative product that brings superpowers to sellers;

Build and test client software with complex server, network and hardware interactions;

Craft pixel-perfect, intuitive UI that delights our sellers with its ease of use;

Work with a world-class team of experienced and dedicated engineers, product managers and designers;

Deliver features to our growing base of subscribers, shipped at a rapid cadence;




You Have




Qualifications



4+ years of Android development experience, and an excellent command of engineering fundamentals. We’re hiring at multiple levels of experience so if Retail sounds interesting to you, don’t hesitate to apply

Interest in learning (and helping us evolve) client engineering practices at scale

Unwavering commitment to customer experience and the quality of your work

An eagerness to share your ideas, and openness to those of others




Technologies We Use And Teach




Kotlin for development

Application architecture based on Square’s modern open source library, Workflow

Espresso UI testing

Protocol buffers for network transport

Gradle for our build environment

Open source libraries like LeakCanary, Jetpack Compose, Dagger, Anvil, Okhttp, and more

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


Amazon Web Services (AWS) is looking for talented software engineers to play a critical role in launching a brand new service from the ground up. AWS customers are pushing the envelope for their customers in new and exciting ways; they want to focus on their core business and not on gluing together various developer tools or building bespoke solutions to get their code to production. Developers want a smooth user experience that highlights things that require attention and allows them to focus on writing code, not managing development tools and scaffolding. At the same time, enterprises want their developers to use a toolchain that is secure and promotes safe best practices by default.

The AWS Code Suite services were built to address this need. AWS CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy allow customers to author, validate, and release software and infrastructure changes easily, quickly, and safely. But we aren’t content with the current products - we see a big opportunity to compliment the existing tools with a new offering that we believe will provide more seamless experiences between services and will make our customers more productive.

That’s where you come in. As a senior engineer on the AWS Developer Tools team, you will play a lead role in the creation of a product that will be used (and loved!) by millions of engineers. You will lead a strong team as we shape the future of continuous delivery. You will play a key role in all aspects of the software delivery process including requirements gathering, ideation, technical design, implementation, release, and operation. You will design distributed systems at an epic scale, all in service of delighting customers.

Sound like this is in your wheelhouse? Then please apply! We would be excited to have you on the team.



About Us



Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Description



Are you ready to pursue some of the hardest scalability, performance, and distributed computing challenges in AWS? Our team's vision is to be the world's authoritative provider of AWS computing insight, where customers can understand, control and optimize usage of AWS products. Because we sit at the nexus of all AWS services and interact directly with end-customers, we build relationships with teams across AWS to ensure that we offer a secure and reliable customer experience. We take inputs from these services and merge them with the millions of events every second to produce actionable insight to our customers.

Providing a scalable platform to support AWS’ expanding business is a complex architectural challenge, and accurate cost and usage information is a critical piece. Enterprise-level customers make large dollar-value decisions based on the timeliness, accuracy, and detail of the data provided by our products.

You will take on architectural challenges in making billions of usage records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems. The AWS Insights is changing fast and this is a dynamic role where you will both learn and grow while you contribute to our success.

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.



Position Responsibilities




 Collaborate in the design, implementation, and deployment of successful internet-scale systems and services in support of our commerce operations and the businesses they support.

 Help define our secure, scalable, distributed and event-driven systems.

 Work with extraordinary teams delivering demanding projects.

 Functionally decompose complex problems into simple, straight-forward solutions.

 Understand system interdependencies and limitations.

 Share your knowledge of the most effective performance, scalability, architecture, and engineering patterns and methods.





Basic Qualifications




 Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related field with 3+ year relevant experience.

 Shown skill with Java, C++, or equivalent object-oriented programming languages.

 Knowledge about functional programming in Scala/Java8

 Strong problem solving and analytical abilities.

 Understanding of algorithmic design and complexity analysis.




Preferred Qualifications




 MS in Computer Science or equivalent

 5+ years of industry experience.

Description



Are you ready to pursue some of the hardest scalability, performance, and distributed computing challenges in AWS? Our team's vision is to be the world's authoritative provider of AWS computing insight, where customers can understand, control and optimize usage of AWS products. Because we sit at the nexus of all AWS services and interact directly with end-customers, we build relationships with teams across AWS to ensure that we offer a secure and reliable customer experience. We take inputs from these services and merge them with the millions of events every second to produce actionable insight to our customers.

Providing a scalable platform to support AWS’ expanding business is a complex architectural challenge, and accurate cost and usage information is a critical piece. Enterprise-level customers make large dollar-value decisions based on the timeliness, accuracy, and detail of the data provided by our products.

You will take on architectural challenges in making billions of usage records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems. The AWS Insights is changing fast and this is a dynamic role where you will both learn and grow while you contribute to our success.

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Slack's backend services are written in Go and Java, and Slack's API is built on 
 PHP/Hack
 . Our 
 data infrastructure

 Whiteboard a fix to a scaling or reliability problem, then make it happen. 

 Write, review, or provide feedback on a technical design proposal from other infrastructure teams. 




You may be a fit for this role if you:





 Have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related field/ equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience. 

 Have built large-scale systems professionally for 4+ years and can point to things you’ve worked on. 

 Have built reliable, safe distributed systems and understand the engineering and product trade-offs, and how to make a case for either. 

 Work on complex issues where the analysis requires an in-depth knowledge of the company and existing architecture. 

 Love to model modern methodologies for unit tests, code review, design documentation, debugging, and troubleshooting. You've been developing and operating web applications professionally and can talk at length to things you and your teams have built 

 Are curious, inquisitive, and determined to fix things when they break. 




Bonus points

 Experience building and releasing software using Docker containers 

 Experience with Kubernetes 



 Edge Services is a diverse and inclusive team that is quickly growing and building the future of Slack’s infrastructure.

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


Come join a creative team pursuing some of the hardest scalability, performance, and computing challenges in AWS. Join the excitement of building new customer facing capabilities from the ground up and turning customer needs into elegant, user-centered designs.

Our team's vision is to be the world's authoritative provider of computing insight, where customers can understand, control and optimize usage of products. Because we sit at the nexus of all services and interact directly with end-customers, we build relationships with teams across to ensure that we offer a secure and reliable customer experience. We take inputs from these services and merge them with the millions of events every second to produce actionable insight to our customers. Providing a platform to support AWS's expanding business is a complex architectural challenge, and accurate cost and usage information is a critical piece. Enterprise-level customers make large dollar-value decisions based on the timeliness, accuracy, and detail of the data provided by our products.

You will take on architectural challenges in making billions of usage records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems. You will have the opportunity to learn and use cutting edge technologies like Kinesis, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, and more. Additionally, you will build meaningful software that helps to enable our largest customers to be able to evaluate their cost and usage data. The AWS Insights team is changing fast and this is a dynamic role where you will both learn and grow while you contribute to the team's success.

We are looking for candidates who thrive in a fast-paced start-up like environment and want to invent the future. We are looking for an engineer to contribute to innovative solutions, while demonstrating leadership, technical competence, and craftsmanship.



In This Role You Will




 Help to define the system architecture, own and implement specific components, and help shape the overall experience.

 Collaborate closely with product managers and other software developers to help define the scope of the product.

 You will take responsibility for technical problem solving, creatively meeting product goals, and developing best practices.

 You will demonstrate cross-functional resource interaction to accomplish your goals.

 Write high-quality, efficient, testable code in and other object-oriented languages.

 Build highly available, secure, and event-driven systems.

 Collaborate with and learn from some of the best software developers in the industry.

 Find out what it takes to engineer secured systems for Amazon Web Services.

 Contribute to planning, architecture, implementation, testing, and process improvement.

 Share your knowledge of the most effective performance, scalability, architecture, and engineering patterns and methods.


Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.


 We own the mission-critical data aggregation layer powering AWS Billing Console.

Description



Are you ready to pursue some of the hardest scalability, performance, and distributed computing challenges in AWS? Our team's vision is to be the world's authoritative provider of AWS computing insight, where customers can understand, control and optimize usage of AWS products. Because we sit at the nexus of all AWS services and interact directly with end-customers, we build relationships with teams across AWS to ensure that we offer a secure and reliable customer experience. We take inputs from these services and merge them with the millions of events every second to produce actionable insight to our customers.

Providing a scalable platform to support AWS’ expanding business is a complex architectural challenge, and accurate cost and usage information is a critical piece. Enterprise-level customers make large dollar-value decisions based on the timeliness, accuracy, and detail of the data provided by our products.

You will take on architectural challenges in making billions of usage records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems. The AWS Insights is changing fast and this is a dynamic role where you will both learn and grow while you contribute to our success.

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.



Position Responsibilities




 Collaborate in the design, implementation, and deployment of successful internet-scale systems and services in support of our commerce operations and the businesses they support.

 Help define our secure, scalable, distributed and event-driven systems.

 Work with extraordinary teams delivering demanding projects.

 Functionally decompose complex problems into simple, straight-forward solutions.

 Understand system interdependencies and limitations.

 Share your knowledge of the most effective performance, scalability, architecture, and engineering patterns and methods.





Basic Qualifications




 Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related field with 3+ year relevant experience.

 Shown skill with Java, C++, or equivalent object-oriented programming languages.

 Knowledge about functional programming in Scala/Java8

 Strong problem solving and analytical abilities.

 Understanding of algorithmic design and complexity analysis.

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


Do you want to create the experiences that empower customers to build serverless applications easily and quickly?

We are the Serverless Application Experience team. We own the developer experience that helps customers who want to build, operate, and govern serverless applications that span across multiple AWS services. We ensure customers have a great multi-service experience.

Customers are excited by the vision of serverless: the ability to quickly deliver applications by writing new business logic without needing to become experts in computing and cloud operations. Compared to traditional architectures, customers increasingly build applications using a collection of services, delivering new applications by writing small amounts of business logic connected to other services. This new approach can be a challenge. Serverless applications are made up of many more parts than traditional applications, and those components and services need to be modeled and managed with tools, CI/CD pipelines, and workflows. We believe this challenge of helping customers “cross the chasm” into serverless is another opportunity to delight our customers and make them even more successful. We own the end-to-end experience, working across multiple services, for customers who want to build, operate, and govern serverless applications. We work closely with the service experience teams to deliver simple, powerful, and reliable tools to help customers get to production as quickly as possible. In other words, while each service (Lambda, API Gateway, EventBridge, SQS, etc.) will maintain their developer experience, this team will ensure customers have a great multi-service experience.

We seek engineers to build the next generation of tooling for our Serverless Application Experience. This includes a web experience, CLIs, SDKs, and frameworks.



About Us



Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee- led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 16 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically four to six weeks of on call a year. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Key job responsibilities


 Owning the complete development cycle (requirement gathering, design, implementation, roll-out and support) of developer toolings for Serverless Application development.

 Participate product discussions with product managers to shape the product roadmap.

 Creating internal tools to help triage operational issues easily.





Basic Qualifications

 Bachelor's degree in computer science related fields OR 1+ years equivalent experience in software development

 2+ years of non-internship professional software development experience

 Programming experience with at least one modern language such as Java, C++, or C# including object-oriented design

 1+ years of experience contributing to the architecture and design (architecture, design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and current systems.




Preferred Qualifications




 Experience in communicating with users, other technical teams and senior management to collect requirements, describe software product features, technical designs and product strategy.

 Knowledge of professional software engineering practices &amp; best practices for full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, continuous deployments, testing and operations.

        We're Coinbase. We're the world's most trusted way to join the crypto revolution, serving more than 89 million accounts in more than 100 countries.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team.

You have a ""can do"" attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn't scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.

Description



Come join a creative team pursuing some of the hardest scalability, performance, and computing challenges in AWS. Join the excitement of building new customer facing capabilities from the ground up and turning customer needs into elegant, user-centered designs.

Our team's vision is to be the world's authoritative provider of computing insight, where customers can understand, control and optimize usage of products. Because we sit at the nexus of all services and interact directly with end-customers, we build relationships with teams across to ensure that we offer a secure and reliable customer experience. We take inputs from these services and merge them with the millions of events every second to produce actionable insight to our customers. Providing a platform to support AWS's expanding business is a complex architectural challenge, and accurate cost and usage information is a critical piece. Enterprise-level customers make large dollar-value decisions based on the timeliness, accuracy, and detail of the data provided by our products.

You will take on architectural challenges in making billions of usage records available for various customers and their use cases. You will be empowered to think big, invent on behalf of our customers, make judgment calls and find elegant solutions to hard problems. You will have the opportunity to learn and use cutting edge technologies like Kinesis, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, and more. Additionally, you will build meaningful software that helps to enable our largest customers to be able to evaluate their cost and usage data. The AWS Insights team is changing fast and this is a dynamic role where you will both learn and grow while you contribute to the team's success.

We are looking for candidates who thrive in a fast-paced start-up like environment and want to invent the future. We are looking for an engineer to contribute to innovative solutions, while demonstrating leadership, technical competence, and craftsmanship.



In This Role You Will




 Help to define the system architecture, own and implement specific components, and help shape the overall experience.

 Collaborate closely with product managers and other software developers to help define the scope of the product.

 You will take responsibility for technical problem solving, creatively meeting product goals, and developing best practices.

 You will demonstrate cross-functional resource interaction to accomplish your goals.

 Write high-quality, efficient, testable code in and other object-oriented languages.

 Build highly available, secure, and event-driven systems.

 Collaborate with and learn from some of the best software developers in the industry.

 Find out what it takes to engineer secured systems for Amazon Web Services.

 Contribute to planning, architecture, implementation, testing, and process improvement.

 Share your knowledge of the most effective performance, scalability, architecture, and engineering patterns and methods.


Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


The CloudTrail team builds and manages one of the largest audit logging systems in the world, providing our users visibility into user activity and resources changes in AWS. Our data is a vital part of how AWS customers demonstrate compliance with internal policies or regulatory standards, create event-based workflows and alarming, perform security analysis, and troubleshoot operational issues.

Every single AWS customer has CloudTrail enabled by default, which means we work with nearly every other AWS service and build scalable systems that process massive amounts of data. We have many interesting problems to solve. Customers want us to be broader, deeper, faster, and smarter. In addition to our customers using their data directly, CloudTrail data is also used by AWS services such as Guard Duty and Config, and several external partners.

This is a full-stack, experienced development position, leaning towards back-end work.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. The CloudTrail team is split between our Seattle and Arlington offices, but this position is based in our Seattle office.

On-Call Responsibility

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new team members by building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior engineers truly enjoy mentoring more junior engineers and engineers from non-traditional backgrounds through one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

We care about your career growth. We try to assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

We are looking for engineers who are customer obsessed and who can learn and dive into distributed systems and database problems to invent simple and elegant solutions. In this role, you will care deeply about customer experience and focus on building performant systems that offer idiomatic interfaces to customers.

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is storage for the Internet. Through the use of pioneering techniques in storage &amp; computing, customers can reliably store their data on Amazon’s proven computing infrastructure to achieve virtually limitless storage capacity at minimal cost. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that enables customers to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere in the world. It provides all customers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to the customers.

As a Software Engineer working on S3 Multi-Region Access Points, you will design and develop globally distributed highly available services that provide robust, safe and scalable ways for customers to build multi-region applications with the same simple architecture used in a single region. You will develop these services using Kotlin, AWS CDK, DynamoDB, Lambda and StepFunctions, on the AWS Cloud Platform. You will encounter challenges in the domains of performance optimization, availability and reliability, software defined networking, authentication and authorization and DNS. You will operate in a fast paced environment, and follow agile methodologies with a high level of ownership. Expect to ship software today that impacts millions of customers tomorrow.

We are looking for Engineers who can solve complex problems at large scale. Can you think big and simplify complex, sometimes never before seen, problems? Can you own a challenge and work with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to deliver results all the while maintaining standards for your customers? If this describes you then please apply today!

Work-life Balance: Our team works together to provide work/life balance for all team members. We recognize that the circumstances of our team members vary, and we balance work across the team so we’re all able to maintain standards on behalf of our customers, while at the same time allowing for rich and happy personal lives.

On-Call Responsibility: S3 services are highly available, but there are times when we occasionally stray away from our normal operations. To minimize the impact of such excursions, we have on-call rotations. However, we set these up so there are focused time periods when you are on-call and when you are not, so you can focus on your day job when not on-call.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth: We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level, etc. We can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Inclusive Team Culture: We have a diverse team and drive towards an inclusive culture and work environment. Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Our team members are active in Amazon’s 10+ affinity groups, sometimes known as employee resource groups, which bring employees together across businesses and locations around the world. These range from groups such as the Black Employee Network, Amazon Women and Engineering, and LGBTQ+.

Does solving technical challenges in cloud computing motivate you? Come join the AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) team and help us innovate solutions for databases in the AWS cloud!

The RDS team is the largest cloud database business in the world, providing super-simple provisioning and management for databases in the cloud. Customers can set up a new database with just a few clicks, and complex administrative tasks like scaling, fail-over, and monitoring are automated by our control systems. Providing simplified management for customers comes with the challenge of building sophisticated and reliable control systems. The systems we build manage huge numbers of databases and vast amounts of storage world-wide, and our service is growing rapidly, requiring constant innovation in our system to handle the next order of magnitude in service scale.

RDS provides customers with databases that have multiple-nines of durability and availability. Achieving this level of reliability require control and monitoring systems that automatically detect and handle failures within seconds, and data replication options that accommodate global distribution and disaster recovery objectives. The challenge is further heightened by needing to handle huge numbers of databases and a wide variety of customer workloads. Also, we know how to have a good time as a team, we celebrate our successes, have team building events and celebrate birthdays and other life events.

As a part of a close-knit team of engineers that are agile, data driven, and highly collaborative, you will work with a wide variety of cutting edge technology to automate enterprise level databases with high reliability at massive scale.

Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one day a month. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause and prioritize fixes to reduce operational load on team.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Role: OPERATIONS WINDOWS SRE - (220000DU)



Location: Toronto, CA






Who are we?


The SRE Operations team at CX Marketing Eloqua are the core responsible for ensuring our production platform stays online, performant and up to date. As senior technologists, we manage our on-prem hardware infrastructure from SAN storage, to Hypervisor to OS and application, as well as planning and executing on our migration to OCI Cloud Infrastructure. 

Our team is dedicated to the continuous improvement of both systems and processes related to delivering the Eloqua application to our customers.

 


Who are we looking for?


We have a global team spanning 4 different geographical sites in North America and India. We are looking for a highly technical member who will plan and execute critical state-of-the-art infrastructure build and improvement projects for the CX Marketing Eloqua application.

If you are looking for a place where you can bring in your creativity and use the latest tools and frameworks look no further 

 


Job Responsibilities 


Following are the essential responsibilities of this role. It is a constantly evolving role with increased responsibilities as the business evolves


Work on varied projects within the CX Marketing Eloqua SRE team.

Work closely with the team in India and North America (Canada and US).

Work on our Legacy and Cloud infrastructure stack and make continual improvements for increased throughput and optimal use of resources.

Troubleshoot escalated issues related to server build consistency, performance, and best practices for key components.

Mentor junior members of the team and interns in technical aspects.

Plan for and execute regular maintenance including OS patching, image updating and deployment of images in legacy and cloud environments.

Work on migrating Eloqua to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using tools like terraform/terragrunt, helm, etc.


 


Our stack and philosophy


Chef, terraform/terragrunt, Hyper-V, IIS, Kafka, Gitlab, Docker, Teamcity, Sensu, Grafana, Prometheus, ELK stack, WebLogic, PowerShell, Ruby/Javascript, RabbitMQ, Systemd, Active Directory, PowerMTA, Windows/Linux, Data Visualization technologies etc..

Our Product stack is on both Windows and Linux, and we develop on Macs. Expertise in both platforms is essential for success.

Scale is our current passion and our backlog of exciting projects are tremendous

While Ruby is our current favorite for most of the development (specifically Chef), it doesn't matter if you are a star programmer in any of the following - Java, C++/C#, Javascript, Python - we will be happy to talk to you too

We are obviously big on databases - Microsoft as well as Oracle. Comfort in SQL is all we are looking for in these positions. Of course, deep knowledge of Oracle databases is an added plus.

Our philosophy is to make the life of our developers, testers and cloud team and eventually our customers as easy as possible.

This would probably be your once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of a startup kind of culture with the benefits of the backing of one of the most reputed and largest companies around.

 


Skill-sets needed:


While we know that not everyone can be a master at everything, we are looking for people with interest and basic understanding of the following

 


Windows 
– Everyone has done windows sometime or other. You will be doing more. Need to know Windows Services layer, APIs and probably done some sort of batch scripting on Windows servers

 


Active Directory
 – Do you know FSMO roles? Familiar with replication, USNs, Kerberos? We use AD in our server infrastructure for almost everything, so knowing how to make it work well is critical

 


Networking
 – We deal with very many networking challenges in our day-to-day work. While we do not expect you to be a network administrator, understanding of the basic concepts of networking is a must have.

 


Chef/Ansible
– Have you done Chef or Ansible? By that what we mean is you have written scripts using these tools, not just used them. If not, how about
 CFEngine, Saltstack, or Puppet?


 


PowerShell
 – Knowing PowerShell scripting is highly valuable in an environment heavily using Windows Server, SQL Server and Active Directory.

 


Linux
 – Need system level knowledge of Linux. Starting from understanding of Kernel architecture, process management and configuring a linux system?

 


Docker and Containers
 – Being able to build and deploy images is a critical part of our operations. We expect all our stack to be containerized in the next several months. Have you heard about this technology and does it interest you?

 


Shell/Perl/Regex
 – Knowing Shell scripting or Perl would show us that you have solid system administration automation experience. 

 


PowerShell
 – Knowing PowerShell scripting is highly valuable in an environment heavily using Windows Server, SQL Server and Active Directory.

 


Agile/Scrums/Kanban/JIRA
 – The SRE team does agile. We have 2 week sprints while managing the day-to-day ad-hoc operational needs.

 


Git
 – You are more than just a Git user. Would you know how to branch, merge, squash, stash, and patch?

 


CI Systems
 – We are big on 
Teamcity
. If you are not, don’t worry, how about 
Jenkins/Buildbot/Electric Commander/Hudson/Circle
 or any other popular ones? Again, we are looking for someone who has modeled workflows in a CI system and has in depth administration knowledge or at least understanding of the concepts. We leverage these systems along with app deployment teams to execute regular and ad-hoc jobs

 


Databases / SQL
 – Being at Oracle developing enterprise systems, we need you to have a pretty good understanding of databases. We prefer Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Database. If your understanding of how these databases work is minimal, we would at least want you to be familiar with SQL syntax from basic (INSERT/SELECT) to intermediate ( JOIN/UNION/SCHEMA/STREAM/etc)

 


Email
 – Email functionality is a core feature of our service. Understanding of SMTP, IMAP as well as best practices using SPF, DKIM, DMARC is beneficial.

 


Communication skills
 – Perhaps this is one of the most important skills that is often overlooked. Our team currently is spread across potentially 6 geographical locations and effective oral and written communication is what’s really going to make it successful. SRE @ Oracle requires people skills in supporting several people around the world and gone are the days when you are a reclusive programmer

API Gateway is the front-door of the Serverless revolution, an approach that lets customers turn business logic and application code into scalable, fault-tolerant production without requiring every developer to become an expert in deployment technologies, and infrastructure management. API Gateway turns daunting tasks such as traffic management, authentication, and authorization, monitoring and API versioning into easily configurable steps. It then helps companies to build their developer eco- and turns their sets and business logic into new revenue streams.

We are looking to grow our API Gateway console development team to help design and deliver new customer facing features for our HTTP APIs product and migrate our REST APIs product to the HTTP APIs platform. We acknowledge that there's room for improvement in our customer experience so we're looking for engineers who are customer obsessed. Being customer obsessed will ensure we're delivering a user interface that exceed our customers expectations. We have a modern React JS based code base that leverages AWS component based design system. For this role in specific, our ideal candidate has a deep understanding of browser technology along with ReactJS, Redux, CSS and HTML. Which will enable them to help set the technical direction for our front end solutions.



About Us



Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee- led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 16 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice. We have a on boarding process to ensure a gradual and supportive transition into going on call.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

AWS Shield protects applications against external threats, like vulnerability exploitation, bad bots, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Customers like Netflix, Dow Jones, Mapbox, Pearson, Rovio, and Amazon.com can focus on their own development knowing that their application is protected by AWS Shield.

Our core competency is automating the detection and mitigation of complex, large-scale security issues. The number of attacks mitigated by AWS has more than doubled year-over-year while our operational burden has declined.

Using the console or API, customers can subscribe to AWS Shield, choose resources to protect, and configure advanced features like health-based detection and proactive engagement. When an application running on AWS is targeted by a DDoS attack, the services that you develop will detect the event, signal mitigation, and generate reports for the customer.

Job Summary




DESCRIPTION


Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world leader in providing a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers tens of thousands of businesses around the world! Amazon API Gateway, an AWS service, is rapidly changing how every company, from 2-person startups to the largest of the Fortune 100, think about building and delivering serverless and traditional applications in the cloud. API Gateway is the front-door of the Serverless revolution, an approach that lets customers turn business logic and application code into scalable, fault-tolerant production without requiring every developer to become an expert in deployment technologies, and infrastructure management. API Gateway turns daunting tasks such as traffic management, authentication, and authorization, monitoring and API versioning into easily configurable steps. It then helps companies to build their developer eco- and turns their sets and business logic into new revenue streams.

We are looking to grow our API Gateway console development team to help design and deliver new customer facing features for our HTTP APIs product and migrate our REST APIs product to the HTTP APIs platform. We acknowledge that there's room for improvement in our customer experience so we're looking for engineers who are customer obsessed. Being customer obsessed will ensure we're delivering a user interface that exceed our customers expectations. We have a modern React JS based code base that leverages AWS component based design system. For this role in specific, our ideal candidate has a deep understanding of browser technology along with ReactJS, Redux, CSS and HTML. Which will enable them to help set the technical direction for our front end solutions.



About Us

Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 16 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-live balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice. We have a on boarding process to ensure a gradual and supportive transition into going on call.

Mentorship &amp; Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.
