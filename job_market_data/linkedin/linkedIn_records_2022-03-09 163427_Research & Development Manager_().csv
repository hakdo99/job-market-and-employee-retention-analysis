About RBR


Since 1973, RBR has been designing and manufacturing oceanographic instruments in Ottawa, Ontario to measure our blue planet. The effects of climate change are being seen from the ocean’s abyss to the polar ice caps and our sensors quantify this change to support better analysis, improved planning, and more effective mitigation strategies. Our instruments measure water parameters in some of the harshest environments on the planet! They are mounted on underwater drones, dropped out of planes, and sent to the bottom of the ocean – sometimes for years at a time – all in an effort to get precise and accurate data to support climate research! We have been fortunate to be able to partner with some of the world's leaders in the field of ocean science, like Fisheries and Oceans Canada, The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, The Norwegian Polar Institute, and The British Antarctic Survey, just to name a few!

About RBR


Since 1973, RBR has been designing and manufacturing oceanographic instruments in Ottawa, Ontario to measure our blue planet.

Our instruments measure water parameters in some of the harshest environments on the planet! They are mounted on underwater drones, dropped out of planes, and sent to the bottom of the ocean – sometimes for years at a time – all in an effort to get precise and accurate data to support climate research! We have been fortunate to be able to partner with some of the world's leaders in the field of ocean science, like Fisheries and Oceans Canada, The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, The Norwegian Polar Institute, and The British Antarctic Survey, just to name a few!

WHITEHORSE, YUKON
 


Whitehorse: a great place to live if you love the outdoors! Legend says Whitehorse got its name when gold seekers thought rapids rushing through Miles Canyon looked like charging white horses.

The World Health Organization once named Whitehorse as having the cleanest air in the world.

Work at CBC/Radio-Canada 


Behind the scenes, but ahead of the curve: help us develop the next-generation public broadcaster.

Created in 2015 to align, lighten and modernize infrastructure, the Technology &amp; Infrastructure (T &amp; I) team is the backbone and the future forward arm of CBC/Radio-Canada. We are the people that make stuff work. We make connections; between media content, systems, people and places. We are the space in between.

A place with purpose. CBC/Radio-Canada has always been a highly-regarded pioneer of media technology. Not just in Canada, but around the world. Today, we’re transforming ourselves from conventional radio and television broadcaster into a modern digital media company. Technology is the driving force. T &amp; I is the team making it happen.

You will have to operate within very tight deadlines in an evolving environment, ensuring that processes are optimized according to best practices while demonstrating the ability to proactively research and analyze solutions using all available tools and resources (internet, intranet, colleagues, etc.).

You will also be required to coordinate activities by collaborating in the development of preliminary work plans and user tests, as well as by regularly informing the manager responsible for the risks and problems encountered.


 What’s in it for you?
