About Nanalysis Corp.



Nanalysis Scientific Corp. is a public company (TSXV:NSCI, FRA:1N1, USA:OTC:NSCIF). The company is a global manufacturer and seller of compact Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy products. The Nanalysis 60 MHz was the first portable, high-resolution 60 MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer released in the market in 2013. These instruments are notable for their ease of use, low-maintenance, accessibility, affordability and automatability. In 2019, Nanalysis introduced the 100 MHz spectrometer, representing the highest resolution instrument available on the market. Designed with flexibility in mind, the instruments can be configured as traditional NMR spectrometers or programmed as analyzers for specific industrial applications (oil and gas, chemical, pharma, biotech, food science, atomic agencies, cannabis, mining). Nanalysis' benchtop NMR technology has been widely recognized, including being named Company of the Year in Global Portable NMR in the prestigious Frost &amp; Sullivan award for three consecutive years.

In 2020 Nanalysis expanded its portfolio of magnetic resonance technology acquiring RS2D and their superior Cam4TM technology offering their high-field NMR PulseTMconsole (200-600 MHz), preclinical MRI and MR product line. RS2D, founded in 2004, specializes in the design and manufacture of a suite of magnetic resonance products powered by the versatile Cam4TM which will soon power all our spectrometers, including MRI consoles and the PulseTM NMR console suitable for 200-600 MHz instruments. These are powered by innovative software packages, PRim and SPINit , for MRI and NMR, respectively. In 2011, RS2D helped pioneer preclinical imaging with the first rodent MRI system made from a superconducting cryogen-free magnet.

Nanalysis continues to grow with its new acquisition of One Moon Scientific, based in New York. The company was formed in 2005 and specializes in software used to process and analyze NMR data in different materials, from proteins to nucleic acids. Today, their software, NMRViewJ, is considered to be one of the leading programs that scientists use for NMR data analysis. Their newest open source software, NMRFx Analyst, is under rapid development and includes additional tools for NMR analysis to increase accessibility of processing. Both software suites are compatible on multiple platforms including Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.

In 2022 Nanalysis acquired KPrime, a Phoenix-based contract sales and service organization focused on scientific instrumentation and solutions for food, pharmaceutical, security, and chemical, and oil &amp; gas sectors, along with imaging systems. With headquarters in Phoenix and Calgary, Nanalysis is able to expand its North American sales division and reach a wider market.
