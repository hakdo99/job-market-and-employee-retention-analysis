        Our mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. Reddit is a community of communities where people can dive into anything through experiences built around their interests, hobbies, and passions. With more than 50 million people visiting 100,000+ communities daily, it is home to the most open and authentic conversations on the internet. From pets to parenting, skincare to stocks, there’s a community for everybody on Reddit. For more information, visit redditinc.com.

We are looking for a Data Scientist to work with our Ads Formats product team. You will partner closely with cross functional team members such as Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, etc. in utilizing data to drive product decision and strategy. In addition to strong analytical skills, you will have an interest in data quality and collaborating with engineers to ensure we have the data we need to assess product performance.



How You’ll Have Impact



Advertising is Reddit’s primary business model and we have an ambitious goal to turn it into a massive business. Although several large digital ad platforms already exist, advertisers are being increasingly drawn to Reddit because of our passionate communities that drive action. This large number of self-governed communities have highly-engaged users who are in an unduplicated mindset of consuming relevant information. This has created the opportunity for Reddit to build a massive and highly differentiated ads business.

We have spent the past few years building the foundations of a modern ad serving system, building features to help brand and performance advertisers find their audiences on Reddit and get high ROI on their ad spend. We’re now ready to build differentiated products on top of those foundations, utilizing data to drive the product decisions for both short term and long term bets.

As a data scientist on the ads data team you’ll be a key player in ensuring we make the right product decisions based on data insights, play with the large data from one of the largest websites, and help define the culture and frameworks for future team members. Reddit sits in a unique place, where there are still a lot of low hanging fruit opportunities that will immediately impact millions of users and thousands of advertisers.



What You’ll Learn




You will partner closely with our Ads Product and Engineering team, which is the core driver of revenue for the company. You’ll play a key role in developing Ads product strategy and experiments. You’ll play with petabytes of data full of user and advertiser interactions to develop a deeper understanding of Reddit’s ads ecosystem. 

In addition, you will work side by side with a world-class org of Engineering, ML, Search, Data Science, Data Warehouse, and Analytics practitioners who work together to create a variety of capabilities for Reddit to be more successful in its decision-making and product creation. In this process, you will be exposed to a variety of new techniques in experimentation, statistical frameworks, machine learning, deep learning, and causal inference.





What You’ll Do




Analyze conversations and behaviors across Reddit's 10,000 interest-based communities, and convert them into insights and product recommendations.

Understand Reddit advertising and help the company improve Ads Revenue while simultaneously improving ROAS (Return on Ads Spend) for advertisers.

Conduct product/feature analyses, opportunity sizing, experimentation (A/B testing) and build dashboards/visualizations to assess product health.

Organize data by designing table schemas, data pipelines, aggregations, alerts and general data infrastructure for the Ads Organization.

Collaborate with various cross-functional stakeholders, including Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, UX Researchers, Data Engineers and Data Warehouse Engineers to lead projects related to organizing and analyzing data.

Be an integral part of the Data Org, leveraging and contributing to the vibrant knowledge base, shared across a community of world-class data experts.





Who You Might Be




2+ years of experience in data analytics or related quantitative role

Job Description



Title: 
Software Engineer – Portal


Reports to: 
Director, Digital Platforms


Location:
 Anywhere in the US, Canada, or Latin America





Job Summary


As a Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.





Role Context


Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). Earlier this year we acquired Strive, an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech companies like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on their technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.





Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity



Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.

Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.

Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product &amp; tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.






Essential Job Functions



Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.

Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.

Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.

Review &amp; Architect: As a Senior Software Engineer you will play a leadership role in code reviews for the team, helping set the engineer bar, defining best practices, and weighing in on major architecture decisions.

Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.






Job Requirements



5-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, this is a proxy but not a hard requirement)

Back-end experience with PHP, Python (Django), MySQL/PostgreSQL and front-end experience with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.

Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.

Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions

Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.

Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required

More About Hopper



Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:


 Hopper’s valuation is now over $ 5B . The company’s valuation has more thantripled since early 2020.

 The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

 According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

 Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT.

 The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually

 Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

 Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products.

Senior Data Scientist


Senior Data Scientist 



Our Capital One Data Team.


Data is at the centre of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Senior Data Scientist on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.


A day in the life of a Capital One Senior Data Scientist 


You’ll work alongside a team that’s leading the next wave of change, using the latest in distributed computing technologies to uncover new ways to help everyday people feel confident about credit.



The Ideal Candidate Will Be




Curious: You ask why, you explore, you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You probably know Python, Scala, or Java and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.

A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).

A Stickler for good software: You have a reverence for DevOps and don’t consider any piece of code complete without a thorough testing suite.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.

Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.


Be ready to join a community of the smartest people you’ve ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.

We’re all-in on the cloud and leaders in the adoption of open source, RESTful APIs, microservices, and containers. We build our own products and release them with a speed and agility that allows us to get new customer experiences to market quickly. And, as a founder-led company, we’re inspired to make, break, do, and do good. So, let’s do something great together.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988!

A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.

Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

You are a problem solver. A fixer. A brilliant thinker driven to resolve intricate issues and eager to learn about all aspects of business.

Execute assignments aiming to improve the efficiency of different functions, such as Operations, Customer Support, Finance, Hiring, M&amp;A, and more.
