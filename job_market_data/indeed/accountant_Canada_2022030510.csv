If it's a fun, hyper-growth startup where people look forward to coming to work Monday mornings, keep reading… RenoRun was born in 2016 with the insight that contractors spend too much time away from their job sites by going to the store to procure materials. Before building out the concept, the co-founders—three construction industry veterans—would sit in different hardware store parking lots around Montreal in the winter, with Tim Horton's coffees, and notebooks in hand. They kept count of anyone coming out in work boots, plus vans and pickup trucks, and compared notes at the end of the day. This was their ""customer."" After noticing that there were roughly 2,000 contractors per hour circulating hardware stores in Montreal, they decided to set out on a crusade to better serve them, and to unleash them from the unpleasantries that had been normalized in the construction industry. Fast forward to today and we're one of the hottest tech start-ups, opening in cities all over Canada and the US, on our mission to 'empower contractors to build the world around us'. Construction professionals don't just want, but deserve, to get time back. So if you're looking for impact, look no further. Come join RenoRun! The Finance division is looking for a Junior Accountant to join their team. In collaboration with your colleagues, you will handle trade related financial transactions for our Canadian and U.S. operations.

As a separate and large federal employer, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) supports and will follow this new policy direction. As of November 8, 2021, all employees of the CRA, including new hires, are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 unless accommodated based on a medical contraindication, religion, or another prohibited ground for discrimination as defined under the Canadian Human Rights Act and attest to their vaccination status. The requirement to be fully vaccinated applies to all employees and new hires, whether they are teleworking, working remotely or working on-site. This condition of employment applies to indeterminate (permanent), determinate (term), and student hiring. Should you reach the point in the staffing process where it is necessary to verify conditions of employment, there will be a requirement to complete an attestation of vaccination status. CRA prioritizes diversity and inclusion and is firmly committed to providing a diverse workforce that reflects the population we serve. CRA’s National Employment Equity (EE) Staffing Strategy strives to eliminate EE gaps for the four EE designated groups: Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, members of visible minorities, and women. Where an EE gap exists at the time of appointment, EE may be used as an appointment criterion for permanent and temporary appointments/staffing actions over six months made through this process.

Here’s a little more about our proposition and the problem that we solve... The overall proposition of the Sharechest connector is in how it very simply engages and connects potential investors and issuers. We believe that there is a fundamental disconnect in the way that organizations (and their websites) are setup and enabled to engage/capture customer leads versus investor ‘leads’ – and that’s where our Connector comes in. Our technology enables simple and timely connections through an increasingly familiar interface (like an active customer service chat-bot) that installs right on-top of your existing website - with no integration required, and it even adds a ‘slick’ factor (that furthers the positive impression made by your brand) through the addition of this increasingly familiar ‘active’ technology. In a very simple way, it lets prospective investors know that you are still actively seeking investment, and provides a way for them to connect as an investor in a way that they know they will be ‘heard’ or their request actioned upon. With the Sharechest Connector - gone are the days of emailing info@ or investorrelations@ (mailboxes that management typically does not see) with connections being lost and money being ‘left on the table’.

Through our suite of novel tools, companies are able to engage and capture leads in order to convert them into investors. At Sharechest, you will have the very unique opportunity to join a new, dynamic start-up that is poised to change the way that issuers and investors connect. Our team includes decades of expertise in capital markets and technology that not only add credentials to our proposition and product, but give you valuable opportunities to learn and grow by working with serial entrepreneurial and seasoned executives with a track record of success. Here’s a little more about our proposition and the problem that we solve... The overall proposition of the Sharechest connector is in how it very simply engages and connects potential investors and issuers. We believe that there is a fundamental disconnect in the way that organizations (and their websites) are setup and enabled to engage/capture customer leads versus investor ‘leads’ – and that’s where our Connector comes in. Our technology enables simple and timely connections through an increasingly familiar interface (like an active customer service chat-bot) that installs right on-top of your existing website - with no integration required, and it even adds a ‘slick’ factor (that furthers the positive impression made by your brand) through the addition of this increasingly familiar ‘active’ technology. In a very simple way, it lets prospective investors know that you are still actively seeking investment, and provides a way for them to connect as an investor in a way that they know they will be ‘heard’ or their request actioned upon. With the Sharechest Connector - gone are the days of emailing info@ or investorrelations@ (mailboxes that management typically does not see) with connections being lost and money being ‘left on the table’. Job description The COO will provide leadership and strategic vision to the organization.
